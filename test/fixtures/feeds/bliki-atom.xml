&lt;p class = 'original'&gt;&lt;a href = 'http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Retread.html'&gt;Retread&lt;/a&gt; of post orginally made on 11 Jan 2007&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"'War and Peace' is a wonderful book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Let me see... pity this book has such a tattered cover"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="quote-attribution"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two sentences, each uses the word 'book'. We glance over
combinations like this
every day without remarking that the word 'book' means something
completely different in each of those sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first sentence 'book' refers to a literary work, one
that's been with us for over a hundred years. In the second sentence
'book' now refers to a physical object that's probably been around for
a lot less. I can easily destroy the latter in my fire, but the former
isn't touched by my flames and will doubtless last longer than I will.
I can put the former on my hard disk with many siblings that
collectively weigh less than the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular ambiguity is startlingly common in natural
language. Think about words like 'car', 'oak', and 'programmer'.
Trying to straighten this out can easily lead you into the darker
corners of semantics in philosophy. For the moment, I'll just explain
how I think about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word 'book' is a term that can refer to multiple
	concepts. The two sentences above illustrate two concepts that
	'book' refers to: the literary work and the physical copy. Since
	most of my readers are programmers I'll use a programming analogy
	and say that there are two distinct classes both of which are called
	'book'. We can disambiguate them by referring to them as the classes
	LiteraryWork and PhysicalCopy. When in the first sentence I
	say that 'War and Peace' is a book, I'm saying that 'War and Peace'
	is an instance of the class LiteraryWork. The second sentence refers
	to the properties of an instance of PhysicalCopy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two concepts are not independent. Unlike a homonym like
right and right (the opposites of left and wrong), these two concepts
have a close relationship &lt;a href="#footnote-polysemy"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. A book [PhysicalCopy] carries on it a
rendering of the book [LiteraryWork]. So I might say that my War and
Peace has a tattered cover. Similarly my Subaru Legacy [instance of
physical car] has a relationship with Subaru Legacy [instance of car
model]. Indeed we might say that the type of my car is Subaru Legacy
[car model]. This kind of relationship is very common and is familiar to people
who do any kind of object or data modeling. You often see similar
structures involving things like Product and Product Type. I wouldn't
use the terms Book and Book Type, but it's fundamentally the same relationship.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spend time modeling, or programming, in almost any domain and you'll
reach a point where you have to take some common term in that domain
and realize it denotes two separate concepts which mean separate
classes (or tables) with different names in your code. When you get
homonyms in your domain language, it's often because the terms are
	used differently in different contexts - what Eric
	Evans calls Bounded Contexts. As Jim Odell liked to point out: "Mary
	had a little lamb" means quite different things to a veterinarian than
	to a restaurateur. The trouble with the type-instance homonym is
	that it occurs even within very tight bounded contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My purpose here isn't to talk much further about modeling these
	kind of situations, that's quite a topic on its own, but to reflect
	on the ambiguity that this common type of homonym causes. The
	really interesting thing about this ambiguity is how &lt;i&gt;little&lt;/i&gt; trouble
	it causes. Humans seem to have no trouble at all switching between
	the multiple concepts and only rarely getting tripped up in the
	process. What's worse, if you actively try to use different terms in
	everyday conversation, it's nearly impossible to keep it up. I
	certainly tried, both in conversation and writing and quickly
	realized it was a lost cause. Not just did I not have the discipline
	but it made me sound like someone with some obscure mental
	condition. (The type-instance case isn't the only one with this
	property, as the phrase "go through the door we painted last
	week" suggests.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a particularly fascinating case of this in my own
	specialty of object-oriented design. We often talk about things like
	"add a method to an object". Yet, of course, we don't add methods to
	objects, we add them to classes. At some point in your career you've
	been the pedant who's pointed that out in a meeting. You've also
	effortlessly glossed over that point in countless conversations since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I came to the conclusion that we absolutely have to be aware
of this homonym. We need to represent the concepts separately and with
different names in our software. But we shouldn't expect to make a
distinction between them in our conversation unless we're in a context
where there is a real danger of confusion, because most of the time
our brains resolve the ambiguity automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean in the context of a
	&lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html"&gt;UbiquitousLanguage&lt;/a&gt;? Firstly we have to do the modeling
	and realize we have different concepts (aware of the homonym). We
	then come up with names for the different concepts that we'll use in
	our Ubiquitous Language and thus in the software
	representation. When coming up with these names, I like to avoid the
	bare homonym: so I wouldn't use "book" in the library context,
	preferring something like 'Literary Work' and 'Physical Copy'. These
	disambiguating terms need to be comprehensible to the domain experts,
	as with anything else in the Ubiquitous Language. Therefore the
	domain experts need to be aware of the homonym and help come up with
	the new terms. We then use the new terms whenever we need the
	precision we gain. However we should be wary of trying to completely
	exorcise the homonym. It effectively becomes a synonym for each of
	the new terms. So if a domain person says "a book has authors" we
	might say "you mean a literary work there, right?" Remember that it
	will feel unnatural to everyone to not use the homonym term, so apply
	the precision with a light touch. Fortunately awareness is 90% of
	the battle here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further consequence of this homonym is that you should always
	have your antenna scanning for it - particularly in the early days of
	working in a new domain. Usually it occurs in terms that are
	absolutely central to that domain - as with books and
	libraries. I've liked using informal class diagrams to model a
	ubiquitous language and I've found it does a good job of rooting out
	these kinds of homonyms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list"&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-polysemy"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;1: &lt;/span&gt;
      Jim White emailed me to let me know that in Linguistics, the
      term "polysemy" is sometimes used to indicate to indicate a word
      that has different, but related, meanings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I was asked to kick off this track with an introductory talk for an hour giving an outline to the important issues in thinking about NoSQL. I talk about the origins of NoSQL, forms of NoSQL data models, the way many NoSQL databases consider the problem of consistency, and the importance of Polyglot Persistence. I was pretty happy with how this turned out and think it&amp;#8217;s a good way to spend an hour if you want to start a journey in understanding NoSQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a video of a &lt;a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=191kCkNya5Q&amp;amp;amp;list=PLEx5khR4g7PJmH05qNUmmo8WzSSaJIzLj&amp;amp;amp;index=7'&gt;panel of NoSQL vendors&lt;/a&gt; that I participated on. This wasn&amp;#8217;t a great discussion - lots of talking past each other, but maybe worth a look for people who are already into the NoSQL world.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Bliki: PurposeOfEstimation</title>

    <updated>2013-02-27T09:56:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PurposeOfEstimation.html</id>
    <category term="bliki"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;My first encounter with agile software development was working
  with Kent Beck at the &lt;a href="/bliki/C3.html"&gt;dawn of Extreme Programming&lt;/a&gt;. One of the things
  that impressed me about that project was the way we went about
  planning. This included an approach to estimating which was both
  lightweight yet more effective than what I'd seen before. Over a
  decade has now passed, and now there is an argument amongst
  experienced agilsts about whether estimation is worth doing at all,
  or indeed is actively harmful &lt;a href="#footnote-anti-estimation-refs"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. I think that to answer this question
  we have to look to what purpose the estimates will be used for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common scenario runs like this: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers are asked for (or given) estimates for upcoming work.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are optimists, so these estimates tend to be too low,
    even without pressure to make them low (and there's usually at
    least some implicit pressure)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;These tasks and estimates are turned into release plans
    tracked with burn-down charts&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Time and effort goes into monitoring progress against these
    plans. Everyone is upset when actuals end up being more
    than estimates. In effort to
    increase pace with the estimates, developers are told to sacrifice
    quality, &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DesignStaminaHypothesis.html"&gt;which only makes things worse&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this narrative, effort put into estimates is, at best, waste
   - since "an estimate is a guess in a clean shirt" &lt;a href="#footnote-clean-shirt"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;. Usually estimates end up being actively harmful as
   they encourage &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureDevotion.html"&gt;FeatureDevotion&lt;/a&gt;, a nasty condition where
   people start valuing ticking off features more than tracking the real
   outcome of the project.&lt;a href="#footnote-metrics"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimates also set expectations, and since estimates are usually
   too low, they set unrealistic expectations. &lt;a href="#footnote-expectations"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; Any increase in time or
   reduction in features is then seen as a loss. Due to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion"&gt;loss-aversion&lt;/a&gt;,
   these losses have a magnified effect. &lt;a href="#footnote-loss-aversion"&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faced with situations like this, it's easy to see how people
   turn their angry glares towards estimation. This leads to an
   increasing notion that anyone indulging in estimating is Not a
   True Agilist. Critics of agile say this means
   that agile development is about developers going off and doing vague
   stuff with promises that it'll be done when its done and you'll like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't share this view of estimation as an inherently evil
   activity. If I'm asked if estimation is a Bad Thing my answer is
   the standard consultants' answer of "it depends". Whenever someone
   answers "it depends" the follow-up question is "upon what". To
   answer that we have to ask why we are doing estimation - as I like
   to say "if it's worth doing well, it's worth asking why on earth you're doing
   it at all".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, &lt;b&gt;estimation is valuable when it helps you make
   a significant decision&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first example of an estimation-informed decision is allocation
   of resources. Organizations have a mostly fixed amount of money and
   people, and usually there are too many worthwhile things to do. So
   people are faced with decisions: do we do A or B? Faced with such a
   decision it's useful to know how much effort (and cost) each will
   involve. To make sensible decisions about what to do, you need to
   have a feel for both the cost and the benefits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is to help with coordination. The blue team
   wants to release a new feature to their web site, but cannot do so
   until the green team builds a new service to give them crucial
   data. If the green team estimates they will be done in two months
   and the blue team estimates that it will take them a month to build
   the feature, then the blue team knows it's not worthwhile to start
   today. They can spend at least a month working on some other
   feature that can be released earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So whenever you're thinking of asking for an estimate, you
   should always clarify what decision that estimate is informing. If
   you can't find one, or the decision isn't very significant, then
   that's a signal that an estimate is wasteful. When you do find a
   decision then knowing it focuses the estimate because the decision
   provides context. It should also clarify the desired precision and
   accuracy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the decision may also lead you to alternative
   actions that may not involve an estimate. Maybe task A is so much
   more important than B that you don't need an estimate to put all
   your available energies into doing it first. Perhaps there is a way
   for blue team members to work with the green team to get the
   service built more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, tracking against a plan should also be driven by how
   it informs decision making. My usual comment here is that a plan
   acts as a baseline to help assess changes - if we want to add a new
   feature, how do we fit it into the &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FivePoundBag.html"&gt;FivePoundBag&lt;/a&gt;?
   Estimates can help us understand these trade-offs and thus decide
   how to respond to change. On a larger scale re-estimating a whole
   release can help us understand if the project as a whole is still
   the best use of our energy. A few years ago we had a year-long project
   that was cancelled after a re-estimate a couple of months in. We
   saw that as a success because the re-estimate suggested the project
   would take much longer than we had initially expected - early
   cancellation allowed the client to move resources to a better target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But remember with tracking against plans that estimates have a
   limited shelf life. I once remember a gnarly project manager say
   that plans and estmates were like a lettuce, good for a couple of
   days, rather wilty after a week, and unrecognizable after a couple
   of months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many teams find that estimation provides a useful forcing
   function to get team members to talk to each other. Estimation
   meetings can help get better understanding of various ways to
   implement upcoming stories, future architectural directions, and
   design problems in the code base. In this case any output
   estimation numbers may be unimportant. There are many ways such
   conversations can happen, but estimation discussions can be
   introduced if these kinds of conversations aren't happening. &lt;a href="#footnote-thrown"&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;
   Conversely if you're thinking of stopping estimation, you need to
   ensure that any useful conversation during estimation still
   continues elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to any conference with agile leanings and you'll hear talks
   of teams that work effectively without estimation. Often this works
   because they, and their customers, understand that making estimates
   isn't going to affect significant decisions. An example is a small
   team working closely with business. If the broader business is
   happy with allocating some people to that business unit, then work
   can be carried out in priority order; often this is helped by the
   team breaking down work into small enough units. &lt;a href="#footnote-small-units"&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; A team's level in the &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/agileFluency.html"&gt;agile fluency
   model&lt;/a&gt; plays a big role here. As teams progress they first
   struggle with estimation, then can get quite good at it, and then
   reach a point where they often don't need it. &lt;a href="#footnote-fluency"&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimation is neither good or bad. If you can work effectively
   without estimation, then go ahead and do without it. If you think
   you need some estimates, then make sure you understand their role
   in decision making. If they are going to affect significant
   decisions then go ahead and make the best estimates you can. Above
   all be wary of anyone who tells you they are always needed, or
   never needed. Any arguments about use of estimation always defer to
   the agile principle that you should decide what are the right techniques for
   your particular context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list"&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-anti-estimation-refs"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;1: &lt;/span&gt;
      A recent read is &lt;a href="http://pragprog.com/magazines/2013-02/estimation-is-evil"&gt;Estimation
      is Evil&lt;/a&gt; an excellent discussion by Ron Jeffries of the
      problems that estimates can cause.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-clean-shirt"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;2: &lt;/span&gt;
      I got this analogy from Ron Jeffries, although I don't have a
      written reference for it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-metrics"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;3: &lt;/span&gt;
      This situation is an excellent example of an &lt;a href="/articles/useOfMetrics.html"&gt;inappropriate use of metrics&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-expectations"&gt;
&lt;h3 class="head-text"&gt;4: Estimates and expectations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I particularly liked a comment on this by my colleague Angela
      Ferguson "the way that estimates set expectations is up to us -
      &lt;i&gt;it is poor project management (whether by project managers or
      other team members)&lt;/i&gt; that results in a client who thinks
      estimates are fixed, or that raw estimates = actual
      effort/duration"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I, in fact, try to practice delivery bad news on a weekly
      basis with my key client, even when things are travelling as
      expected ... 'so we're looking quite well on track now, but if
      we had discovered something that took longer than expected, or a
      requirement had blown up to be larger than expected, or we found
      something new and very important, what do you think the best
      course of action would be?' And then you explore the options -
      cut stories, add time, add capacity, etc. This means that when
      the expected unexpected thing happens (because we know it will
      happen), the conversation doesn't seem new and scary to the
      client."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-loss-aversion"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;5: &lt;/span&gt;
      Very roughly people feel twice as much pain for a loss as
      pleasure for a gain.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-thrown"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;6: &lt;/span&gt;
      If you do this an approach like &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ThrownEstimate.html"&gt;ThrownEstimates&lt;/a&gt; can
      help the discussion move at a good pace.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-small-units"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;7: &lt;/span&gt;
      Of course breaking work down into small units requires some
      implicit estimation, but that's really a different animal to
      the more common explicit estimation activity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-fluency"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;8: &lt;/span&gt;
      James Shore has a recent blog post that &lt;a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Estimation-and-Fluency.html"&gt;details his observations&lt;/a&gt;
      about how fluency influences estimation practice. I think a
      similar analysis of practices at various stages of fluency could
      be very useful.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="acknowledgements"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/h2&gt;

  I repeat myself again in thanking varous ThoughtWorkers on internal
  lists for their comments. In particuarly I'd like to call out Angela
  Ferguson, Dave Pattinson, and Pat Kua. I should also thank James Shore for responding
  so rapidly and well for my question about the links to the fluency model.

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;In many organizations, it's expected that any persistent data
  will be stored in relational databases that are managed by a central
  database management group. There are various reasons for such
  central control, usually centered around using &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/IntegrationDatabase.html"&gt;IntegrationDatabases&lt;/a&gt;.
  Central data groups worry about keeping out malformed data, queries
  that can slow down important shared resources, and consistent data
  models across the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worthy these aims may be, but one consequence of them is
  considerable ceremony about storing data. I often hear complaints
  about change orders that take weeks to add a column to a database.
  For modern application developers, used to short-cycle evolutionary
  design, such ceremony is too slow, not to mention too annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So application development groups tell me of using &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/nosql.html"&gt;NoSQL
  databases&lt;/a&gt; to do an end-run around the DBAs. It helps that they are
  using a "mere datastore" here, not a "proper database". That way the
  DBAs can be kept out of the loop, often not told or happy to not
  care. &lt;a href="#footnote-mongo"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/nodba/sketch.png"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's both good and bad in all this. On the good side, this
  helps break what is often a troubling bottleneck for many
  organizations' application development. The sad divide between
  application developers and database professionals causes many
  problems, and the poor take up of many &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoringDatabases.html"&gt;modern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/evodb.html"&gt;development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UAALBO?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B004UAALBO"&gt;techniques&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/&gt;
  in the DBA community stifles much development. &lt;a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/SharedDataBaseIntegration.html"&gt;Shared
  databases&lt;/a&gt; are a poor integration mechanism, and NoDBA
  development leads to a useful push towards &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/books/sdp.html"&gt;web services&lt;/a&gt; as the
  basis for integration. &lt;a href="#footnote-legacy"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the negative side, using a technology for social reasons can
  often lead to a poor use of the technology. It's not hard to imagine
  people using a NoSQL database to avoid the DBAs when a relational
  &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ApplicationDatabase.html"&gt;ApplicationDatabase&lt;/a&gt; would be a better choice. Data is
  often a vital asset, and bypassing DBA groups may also mean
  bypassing operations groups that know how to keep valuable data
  backed up and secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real answer, of course, is engagement with data professionals
  along the lines of the devops movement. It's the barriers between
  groups that cause much of the ceremony, few data groups are
  populated by devils. We've seen success from inviting DBAs to
  stakeholder meetings where they get to engage with the broad aims of an
  application. We've also had NoSQL projects where we've reached out to the
  DBAs, helped them learn about this new technology, and got valuable
  help in supporting data needs. So although the NoDBA strategy is
  sometimes appropriate, engagement is often better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list"&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-mongo"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;1: &lt;/span&gt;
      It seems particularly common to use MongoDB in this context
      citing MongoDB's ease of installation, configuration, and use.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-legacy"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;2: &lt;/span&gt;
      A large part of the slow response to change requests is that
      many incumbent databases are in essence complex legacy
      applications at the centre of a large web of dependencies. These
      databases are brittle and untested  (&lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Detestable.html"&gt;Detestable&lt;/a&gt;), so it's no surprise that the
      DBAs who look after them are wary of making changes. Such
      systems would make even the smartest developer gun-shy of making changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Like many of us, my colleague &lt;a href='http://thekua.com/atwork'&gt;Patrick Kua&lt;/a&gt; has seen a lot of use of metrics. Management love their metrics. The thinking goes something like this, &amp;#8220;We need a number to measure how we&#x2019;re doing. Numbers focus people and help us measure success.&amp;#8221; Whilst well intentioned, management by numbers unintuitively leads to problematic behavior and ultimately detracts from broader project and organizational goals. Metrics inherently aren&#x2019;t a bad thing; just often, inappropriately used. &lt;a href='http://martinfowler.com/articles/useOfMetrics.html'&gt;This essay&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates many of the issues caused by management&#x2019;s traditional use of metrics and offers an alternative to address these dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Bliki: TransparentCompilation</title>
    <link href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TransparentCompilation.html"/>
    <updated>2013-02-12T09:57:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TransparentCompilation.html</id>
    <category term="bliki"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Increasingly web developers are using languages like &lt;a href="http://coffeescript.org"&gt;CoffeeScript&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://sass-lang.com"&gt;SCSS&lt;/a&gt; that compile to other textual source
  languages that execute in the browser. Such source-to-source
  compilers (also called transpilers &lt;a href="#footnote-transpiler"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;) are not new, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cfront"&gt;Cfront&lt;/a&gt; was widely used in
  the early days of C++ to generate target C code. But for me there is
  a difference that picks out CoffeeScript and SCSS as
  &lt;i&gt;transparent&lt;/i&gt; compilers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With most compilers, you don't care very much about what is
  generated downstream. As long as it follows the semantics of the
  source language it's effectively a big lump of bits. But if you're
  going to generate JavaScript for the browser, this ignorance is hard
  to live with. Debugging environments are getting pretty nifty these
  days, but they are all in terms of the HTML/CSS/JavaScript triad. So
  it's important that you understand how your input language
  translates to its executable target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This constraint has a big effect upon the source language. You
  need to ensure that the output corresponds very clearly to the
  source. When I write this CoffeeScript&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;$(window).on 'touchTap', (event) -&amp;gt;
  window.touchPanel.tap(event)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can easily recognize the resulting JavaScript in my browser debugger&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;  $(window).on('touchTap', function(event) {
    return window.touchPanel.tap(event);
  });
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This remains true even for more complicated bits of CoffeeScript's
 transformation, such as turning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;  runSetupBuild: (slide, positionClass) -&amp;gt;
    switch positionClass
      when 'current', 'next'
        @buildsFor(slide)?.setupBuild?.forwards()
        # ...
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;into&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;    Infodeck.prototype.runSetupBuild = function(slide, positionClass) {
      var _ref, _ref1, _ref2, _ref3;
      switch (positionClass) {
        case 'current':
        case 'next':
          return (_ref = this.buildsFor(slide)) != null ? 
               (_ref1 = _ref.setupBuild) != null ? _ref1.forwards() : void 0 
               : void 0;
        /* ... */
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a lot going on in that transformation - but still the
 correspondence is pretty clear. If I need to debug in that code, I
 can easily see how it matches up to the source CoffeeScript. This is
 the essence of what makes the compilation process &lt;i&gt;transparent&lt;/i&gt; - the
 intention that you will work in the output language &lt;a href="#footnote-output"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, there are source-to-source compilers that don't
 expect you to work in the output language, or see visibility of the
 output language as an unfortunate temporary mechanism. These can
 still be useful, and you see them in the javascript world with
 languages like Dart, GWT, and ClojureScript. It's this difference in
 &lt;i&gt;intention&lt;/i&gt; which is what separates the transparent style of
 transpilation from the more common approach. &lt;a href="#footnote-sourcemaps"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that you have to work at keeping the compilation
 transparent puts limits on what you can do in the source
 language. You don't have the degree of freedom in your language
 constructs that you get with a more unconstrained form of
 compilation. You have to follow the basic semantics of the target
 language, and keep to much the same program structure. These
 constraints haven't been widely talked about as a feature of language
 design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CoffeeScript illustrates that despite these constraints you can
 get a considerable difference in syntax between source and target
 languages. CoffeeScript feels much more like Python in syntax than
 the C-like JavaScript. Such syntactic variation isn't always the
 case, indeed there is an important subset of transparent compilation
 languages that strive to be a superset of the target language. SCSS
 and &lt;a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org"&gt;TypeScript&lt;/a&gt; fit into
 this category - any CSS expression is valid in SCSS. Using a superset
 language makes the correspondence even clearer and I feel works well
 for CSS where CSS's syntax works well but the language misses some
 handy features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some say there's little point in using transparent
 compilation - if you have to understand the target code for
 debugging, what's the value in using a different source? For me, the
 value lies in a couple of directions. First off it's a way of getting
 useful language features that are missing in the target language.
 SCSS gives me handy capabilities such as variables (so I can say
 &lt;code&gt;$light-purple&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;#f8c8fe&lt;/code&gt; and change
 it in only one place should I want to tweak it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More drastic syntax changes, such as CoffeeScript, require
 stronger justification. One of my colleagues put it very well after finishing a
 project. He's an experienced JavaScript programmer and the project
 wrote well-disciplined JavaScript from the beginning. As a result he
 was very happy with the quality of the JavaScript codebase. However
 he still concluded that they would have been better off working in
 CoffeeScript, because it's easier to understand what is going on when
 you're reading the CoffeeScript, even when you're debugging in the
 generated JavaScript code. The transformation may not look like such
 a big deal for small fragments, such as those I show above. But it
 makes a big difference once you're up to hundreds of lines of code,
 let alone beyond.&lt;a href="#footnote-recommend"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list"&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-transpiler"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;1: &lt;/span&gt;
     Hunting around usage, it seem to me that the the term
     "transpiler" is used as a synonym for source-to-source compiler.
     So transpilers may or may not be transparent. I've also seen the
     term "source-to-source translation" used equivalently to
     "source-to-source compilation".
   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-output"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;2: &lt;/span&gt;
     Even with opaque compilation there are cases when people study
     the outputs. Occasionally there are odd behaviors or bugs that do
     require you to dig into the compiler outputs. Some programmers
     like to understand what the compiler is doing, although that's
     got less common as compilers and virtual machines get more
     sophisticated. But such activity is an exception.
   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-sourcemaps"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;3: &lt;/span&gt;
     It's interesting to see whether the development of &lt;a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/"&gt;sourcemaps&lt;/a&gt;
     will shift languages like coffeescript away from transparency.
   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-recommend"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;4: &lt;/span&gt;
     I've only done a few hundred lines of coffeescript while working
     on my infodecks, but I agree with him and will continue to use
     coffeescript for any non-trivial amounts of javascript.
   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Bliki: Saba</title>
    <link href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Saba.html"/>
    <updated>2013-02-01T09:07:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Saba.html</id>
    <category term="bliki"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Recently we returned to one of our favorite places in the world, &lt;a href="http://www.sabatourism.com/"&gt;Saba&lt;/a&gt; - a very small island in
	the Caribbean, close to St Martin. In many ways the best things
	about Saba are the things it doesn't have. There are no beaches, no
	golf courses, no casinos. The mass tourism and resort complexes that
	litter so much of the Caribbean have ignored Saba since it's too
	small and too hilly. As a result the island is wonderfully quiet and
	relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="photo" style="width: 540px"&gt;&lt;img height="358px" src="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/saba/20130119-IMG_0971.jpg" width="540px"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The road, heading up from
  the airport to the village of Hell's Gate.
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result only a few tourists go to Saba. For those that do the
	main activity is diving. Saba is surrounded by coral reefs in a
	marine park, and the resulting diving is excellent. (However since
	the reefs are 30' and deeper, there is little for snorkelers.) Most
	of the diving is a short boat ride from the harbor, so you can take
	your surface time on shore and quickly get to the next dive site
	when you're ready. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was five years since our last trip there, and our favorite
  dive operation, &lt;a href="http://www.sabadeep.com/"&gt;Saba Deep&lt;/a&gt;,
  was under new management. Fortunately Cheri and Tony still have the
  same spirit of small boat dives that made us keep coming back.
  During the days we were there there was often only the two of us in
  the boat (indeed on one occasion there were three dive masters with
  the two of us). The team is relaxed, loves diving, and are very
  professional about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="photo" style="width: 540px"&gt;&lt;img height="405px" src="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/saba/20130117-IMG_0888.jpg" width="540px"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Swimming
  among the rocks and lava outcrops at Tent Reef&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saba also has nice hiking trials that can fill a couple of days.
	The most popular gives you the irresistible opportunity to hike to
	the top of the tallest mountain in the Netherlands (around 3000 ft).
	My favorite trail is the Sandy Cruz trail which loops around the
	rain forest on the north slopes of Mount Scenery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The island's vertical nature yields quite a few special
	stories. Such as the island's road. They got Dutch civil engineers
	to survey a road early this century and were told it couldn't be
	built. So one of the islanders took a correspondence course in civil
	engineering and the islanders built the road themselves. My wife (a
	structural engineer) appreciated both the road and the Dutch
	engineer's reaction - apparently that road would break just about
	every building code in the US. The airstrip is a similar story, it's
	the shortest landing strip you are ever likely to land on. Sit by
	right hand window and you'll swear that that wing will scrape the
	mountainside going in. But in 30 years there's never been an
  accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="photo" style="width: 540px"&gt;&lt;img height="405px" src="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/saba/20130118-IMG_0952.jpg" width="540px"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hiking
  the Sandy Cruz trail&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another new experience for us was to stay at the &lt;a href="http://www.queensaba.com"&gt;Queen's Garden&lt;/a&gt; resort. It's an
	extremely nice resort that does dive packages with Saba Deep and
	we'll be happy to return there again. They offer good food, and
	there's also good restaurants in Windwardside - we had good meals at
	Brigadoon and &lt;a href="http://www.edensaba.com"&gt;Eden&lt;/a&gt;. We don't
  expect it will be five years before we return.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Big Data&amp;#8221; has leapt rapidly into one of the most hyped terms in our industry, yet the hype should not blind people to the fact that this is a genuinely important shift about the role of data in the world. The amount, speed, and value of data sources is rapidly increasing. Data management has to change in five broad areas: extraction of data from a wider range of sources, changes to the logistics of data management with new database and integration approaches, the use of agile principles in running analytics projects, an emphasis on techniques for data interpretation to separate signal from noise, and the importance of well-designed visualization to make that signal more comprehensible. Summing up this means we don&amp;#8217;t need big analytics projects, instead we want the new data thinking to permeate our regular work. &lt;a href='http://martinfowler.com/articles/bigData'&gt;(go to the infodeck)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Bliki: InternalReprogrammability</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I was programming away and wanted to add an empty line above
  where I was currently typing. The editor I was using doesn't have
  this feature built-in, and I'd finally had this desire enough that I
  really wanted it. I did a quick google search, found a few lines of
  code, pasted them into my startup file, executed them, and lo I
  could now create empty lines above with a single keystroke. It took
  just a couple of minutes, I didn't have to install any plugins, or
  restart the editor - this is normal everyday business for an emacs
  user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emacs is an elderly piece of software, &lt;a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/emacs-timeline.html"&gt;dating back to the mid
  70's&lt;/a&gt;. Its philosophy of allowing people to easily extend it by
  modifying the live environment is something shared with a few other
  elderly-but-groundbreaking systems, such as lisp machines and
  Smalltalk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That philosophy seems rarer now. Certainly there are plenty of
  extensible systems, you can install plugins for
  browsers like Firefox and editing suites like Eclipse. The whole
  free/open source movement is about giving you access to the code
  that runs your machines so you can (in theory) tweak it to your
  heart's content. But there's a palpable difference between
  extensions in most of these environments and the kind of
  reprogramming you do in emacs or Smalltalk. Something about how it's
  easy to quickly do small modifications, such as the new command I
  added above. It's also about doing it without leaving the
  environment - I don't fire up some separate toolchain to add an
  emacs function, I work within emacs itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also different to tools that add some kind of "macro
  capability". Adding a new elisp function is exactly how emacs is
  programmed itself - there is no difference between how you program
  little extensions and the core programming of the software. This
  unity allows you to reach deep into the editor's guts. It also means
  that your modifications aren't relegated to some "scripts" menu -
  they are indistinguishable from any other part of the tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This capability is also a philosophy about how you relate to your
  tools. For many people the software you use is a relatively fixed
  product. Even plugins add a relatively limited menu of options.
  Internally reprogrammable tools allow you to add or change any parts
  of your software, allowing you to craft your tools to exactly fit
  your metaphorical hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This thinking even applies to programming languages themselves.
  Both Lisp and Smalltalk are minimal languages that make it easy to
  extend the language in such a way that extensions look identical to
  the core. Neither language has any special syntax for such basic
  language features as conditional logic. This flexibility allowed
  Smalltalk to add exception handling without any language
  changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest issues with internal reprogrammability is the
  resulting fragmentation of instances of the software. As I modify my
  emacs instance with lots of personal functions, I'm creating my own
  custom version of emacs that's tightly coupled to the emacs
  configuration on my machine. Inevitably this raises questions about
  dealing with upgrades to the core application and on how easy it is
  to share my functions with others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systems with plug-in
  architectures and macro languages handle this by reducing the
  surface area of customization, but as &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/nicferrier"&gt;Nic Ferrier&lt;/a&gt; put it so well: "A
  reprogrammable system is incredibly powerful. Abusing the power is
  always possible and it's a point of principle in a reprogrammable
  system that people &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; be able to abuse it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emacs community is, of course, a good example of how this has
  progressed in practice. Emacs has stabilized enough that, despite
  regular updates, most people are able to upgrade without serious
  headaches. Emacs has used package management systems to help
  distribute sharable changes - there's been much progress in thinking
  about how to share code since the original Emacs and Smalltalk days.
  The rise of distributed version control tools adds more ideas for
  managing shared code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the sense that internal reprogrammability is a
  mostly-forgotten philosophy, there are some interesting flickers of
  life. At &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/gotoAarhus2011.html"&gt;gotoAarhus2011&lt;/a&gt; I was struck by how well &lt;a href="http://moosetechnology.org"&gt;Moose&lt;/a&gt; (a tool for assessing
  codebase health) used reprogrammability to help you gradually build
  up health-check analysis. Emacs is still widely used and being
  pushed into new frontiers. A group of emacs developers have built a
  &lt;a href="http://nic.ferrier.me.uk/blog/2012_08/elnode-nears-1-point-0"&gt;node-like
  web-server in emacs&lt;/a&gt;. Ward Cunningham's recent thinking on
  developing the &lt;a href="https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki"&gt;smallest
  federated wiki&lt;/a&gt; includes a strong element of reprogrammability
  through the ability to &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/33131381"&gt;create
  your own javascript functions&lt;/a&gt; to manipulate data on your
  pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If internal reprogrammability is rare for tools aimed at
  programmers, it's even rarer for tools aimed at non-programmers.
  I've often wondered if that ought to change. What would come from
  making more tools exhibit this quality? Would this encourage more
  people to learn about programming, the better to control the
  environment that they spend so much time in? This was certainly part
  of &lt;a href="http://www.mprove.de/diplom/gui/kay72.html"&gt;Alan Kay's
  vision of the dynabook&lt;/a&gt;. He saw children not as passive consumers
  of media, but actively programming their environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming is not easy, and I'm not one to underplay the
  challenges programmers face every day. But that doesn't mean that
  internal reprogrammability should be relegated to 1970's vision of
  the future. A large part of why modern dynabooks lack the internal
  reprogrammability of Kay's vision is because it hasn't been made a
  high-enough priority. Perhaps that's something we should think about
  more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My site hasn&amp;#8217;t seen any updates for over a month, so I thought I&amp;#8217;d make a quick note of what I&amp;#8217;ve been up to. On the whole I&amp;#8217;m not someone who tries to make a regular schedule of site updates - I write as I have the time, energy, and inspiration to do so. Regular articles were important in the days of magazines, but in the online world with notifications via RSS and twitter, I don&amp;#8217;t see any reason to tie myself to a schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually when I go quiet for a few weeks, it&amp;#8217;s due to travel. When I&amp;#8217;m on the grind of speaking I&amp;#8217;m too busy, tired, and grumpy to do any writing. But that&amp;#8217;s not the reason for my recent quiet period, as I&amp;#8217;ve been happily at home. Indeed I&amp;#8217;ve been working steadily at a couple more &lt;a href='http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Infodeck.html'&gt;infodecks&lt;/a&gt;, and this involves both working on the content of the infodecks and on the toolchain to build them. I&amp;#8217;ve added more features to the toolchain in addition to what I had for the &lt;a href='http://martinfowler.com/articles/multiMobile'&gt;multi-mobile deck&lt;/a&gt;, which should provide a more dynamic experience. I&amp;#8217;ve been enjoying the mix of writing and building tools to support that writing - and I expect to be publishing these infodecks after the Christmas/New Year slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Bliki: Infodeck</title>
    <link href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Infodeck.html"/>
    <updated>2012-11-16T09:30:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Infodeck.html</id>
    <category term="bliki"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;When I rant on at my colleagues about the evils of
  &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Slideument.html"&gt;Slideuments&lt;/a&gt;, I do hear a useful push-back. Many
  people now like to communicate through slide decks that aren't meant
  to be used for presentations, just to be read. People like me can
  snark about managers these days being unable to read anything that
  doesn't look like a bullet point, but there are advantage to these
  infodecks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can use spatial layout to help explanation&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;They discourage long prose that people don't read&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It's easy to include diagrams as primary elements in the
    communication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this can lead to a document that's more approachable and
  easier to communicate information than a traditional prose text
  would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a deck is intended for reading and not for projection,
  then I don't count it as a slideument. Slideuments are bad because
  they try to do two different things, but an infodeck is there only
  for reading, so can be done well. Often, of course, they aren't but
  that's a problem in the execution rather than the fundamental concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infodecks are an interesting form to me, if only because it
  seems nobody takes them seriously. Most users look at them as something
  they just knock up with PowerPoint, and writers with pretentions to
  seriousness (such as myself) consider infodecks to be beneath us. I'm beginning to
  think we should take them more seriously. We should think and talk
  more about how to make them effective as communication vehicles.&lt;a href="#footnote-fiction"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason that these are likely to grow is that increasingly we
  are communicating on computer devices and not using paper. Modern
  computers have bright multi-color screens, and aren't worried about
  conserving paper. So a colorful, diagram-heavy approach that uses
  lots of virtual pages is an effective form of document - especially
  as tablets become more prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So over the last year or so I've begun exploring using infodecks
  as first-class forms of communication. You can see a couple that I've produced so far&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/articles/nosql-intro.pdf"&gt;An introduction to NoSQL&lt;/a&gt;, which is a PDF&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/articles/multiMobile"&gt;Developing software for multiple mobile devices&lt;/a&gt;, which is HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using just a couple of examples is only enough to make tentative
  conclusions, but is enough to make me want to continue exploring
  this medium. Both of these infodecks are relatively high-level,
  non-technical pieces, indeed I visualized one of our senior sales
  managers as part of my target audience.  Infodecks naturally seem to
  fit to this kind of audience, but I want to also try them for
  something more technical in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think PDF works best for most people, since often these will be
  emailed around. I used Apple's Pages application for the NoSQL
  infodeck, and I think a page-layout program is a better fit for the
  form that a presentation program such as PowerPoint or Keynote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my purposes, however, HTML is a better fit. I write mostly
  for this website, and HTML is the language of the web. Also with
  HTML I have the option to use dynamic elements, such as animation,
  which isn't possible with PDF. The downside is the lack of tools.
  There are tools out there to do HTML slideshows, but they are mostly
  aimed at live presentation tools using the &lt;a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1961953"&gt;Bullet-Riddled
  Corpse anti-pattern&lt;/a&gt;. Infodecks have different needs to live
  presentations and even though bulleted sentences are less of a
  problem for infodecks, I want to use many other techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However it does make sense to use existing HTML based tools as a
  base. For the multi-mobile deck  I originally used &lt;a href="http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/"&gt;deck.js&lt;/a&gt; which combines a
  good set of basic slide functionality with a nicely extensible
  architecture. For later decks I explored adding animation using
  animation &lt;a href="http://home.heeere.com/tech-deckjs-ext.html"&gt;extensions to deck.js
  &lt;/a&gt;done by R&#xE9;mi Emonet. R&#xE9;mi was extremely helpful at sorting out various
  niggles that are particular to my rather odd usage. However I hit an
  impassable road-block - deck,js, like most HTML-based presentation
  tools, loads the whole slide deck into memory. While this makes
  sense for live presentations, it sadly crashes devices - such as my
  iPad 1 - with the decks I was working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result I had to write my own javascript platform for hosting
  the decks. This just loads a few slides at a time, so trades
  resonsiveness for less memory usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't ever like writing HTML directly, so I compose the deck
  using my usual approach - a custom XML vocabulary that I transform
  into HTML using an extension of &lt;a href="https://github.com/martinfowler/mfweb"&gt;my usual transformation
  toolchain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as working on the toolchain, I'm also working on the
  compositional style to use for infodecks. So far a core element is
  having a lede-and-details approach to the text. Most slides have a
  lede, a single sentence in a large font that summarizes the
  narrative. More details appear in text blocks. The idea is that the
  reader can get a good sense of the what the deck says by skipping
  through the slides just reading the ledes. When they want more
  detail they can read the more detailed text. The limited feedback
  I've gathered so far seems to support that this is working as I intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detail paragraphs are link bullets, but can be longer than
  what people put in live decks. I think of them as short paragraphs
  rather than bulleted sentences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diagrams are key to making the infodeck style work. For the HTML
  toolchain, I've been focusing on using SVG. I did this partly
  because this way everything scales nicely, but also because I can
  take advantage of the fact the SVG objects are DOM objects that I
  can manipulate through css and javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lede font I use, is a good example of using SVG. The font I'm
  using is Marydale, which we use in ThoughtWorks for much of our
  material. We have a company-wide license, but it's not a free for
  downloads and I didn't fancy the messy pricing arrangements. So what
  I do is convert it to SVG shapes in the toolchain. Sadly this means
  the text isn't selectable, but it allows me to use the font I
  want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="appendix"&gt;(I originally posted the first edition of this entry on
  December 19th, 2011. I've updated it with my recent thoughts on building Infodecks.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list"&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-fiction"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;1: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://mikebroberts.com"&gt;Mike Roberts&lt;/a&gt;
      pointed me to an interesting example of an infodeck in fiction,
      one of the chapters of Jennifer Egan's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307477479?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0307477479"&gt;

      which I think is more than any of my infodecks will ever do. &lt;a href="http://jenniferegan.com/books"&gt;The powerpoint
      chapter&lt;/a&gt; is available online, it makes sense on its own.
      The book's chapters are short stories linked
      through common characters.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;As I write this towards the conclusion of the US presidential
  election &lt;a href="#footnote-timing"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;,
  there's a side debate that's appeared about the forecasts produced
  by &lt;a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;Nate
  Silver&lt;/a&gt;. Many Republicans claim he's a
  shill for the democrats and his forecast of an 85% chance of an
  Obama win is bogus &lt;a href="#footnote-85%"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;. Part of me wishes I knew
  more innumerate Republicans that I could make side-bets
  with. Perhaps a better wish would be that the polls were the other
  way around as I have more Democratic-leaning friends. In reality
  either way I wouldn't gain too much as most people I know are
  numerate. Sadly this isn't true in general - this side-show is an
  illustration of the deep illiteracy most people have for
  probability, which has some important ramifications for society in
  general and software development in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I've been reading around this, it's not hard to find evidence
  of probabilistic illiteracy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many people claim that Silver is predicting an Obama victory.
    This isn't true, Silver is saying his model forecasts an 85%
    chance of an Obama victory, which is not at all the same thing.
    (It's roughly equivalent to saying that Romney will win if he
    takes a die and rolls a 6, which is really not that
    unlikely. &lt;a href="#footnote-roll-6"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It's said that you shouldn't listen to Silver because polls
    are often wrong, but Silver states his model does attempt to take this into
    account. Silver says the polls confidently state an Obama victory,
    but his model gives Romney a 15% chance of a win because &lt;a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/03/nov-2-for-romney-to-win-state-polls-must-be-statistically-biased/"&gt;that's
    the chance that the polls are wrong&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;People claim that Silver will be proven right or wrong on
    Tuesday when the election is held. But one event cannot say much
    about an underlying distribution. You'd have to hold many tens of
    elections to really test the model. &lt;a href="#footnote-test-model"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This side-debate has caught my interest because it taps many of what I
  see as fundamental problems people have with understanding
  probabilities and how to use them properly. To begin with there's
  the matter of certainty - people want to hear a binary answer rather
  than a probabilistic one. We see this, of course, in project
  planning where people want firm numbers rather than ranges and
  probability estimates for various outcomes. That difference between
  85% and 100% can lead to some serious errors. I've developed a
  strong distrust of certainty, to the point that the more certain
  someone seems to be, the less I'm inclined to believe them. &lt;a href="#footnote-certainty"&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One aspect of this dispute is how you should use the poll
  information to make forecasts. If I head over to &lt;a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/"&gt;RealClearPolitics&lt;/a&gt; today, I
  see the election as a "toss-up", because a critical 11 states are
  marked as "toss-ups" in their analysis. Silver says that this
  conclusion is profoundly wrong. RCP's current poll average shows a
  3.9% average poll lead for Obama in Ohio. Silver argues that when you
  average these multiple polls, the margin of error due to statistical
  sampling &lt;a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/03/nov-2-for-romney-to-win-state-polls-must-be-statistically-biased/"&gt;is
  about 1.5%&lt;/a&gt; - so if the polls are accurate Obama will win in Ohio
  (and you certainly can't call Ohio a toss-up, which implies 50%
  odds).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons why people are implying this race has
  tighter probabilities than Silver does. Some are reasonable, such as
  disagreements about the model Silver uses for his forecast. Some are
  less reasonable: people are afraid of being seen to be wrong, they
  are indulging in partisan cheerleading &lt;a href="#footnote-bias"&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;, or they
  want make the race seem more exciting in order to gain eyeballs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One argument is that this inappropriate use of "toss-up" is a
  consequence of probabilistic illiteracy. Since people don't
  understand what 85% means, then we'll call it a toss-up. As there's
  plenty of empirical evidence for this confusion, I have some
  sympathy for this argument. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the real issue here is the underlying probabilistic
  illiteracy. Increasingly we are faced with a world where
  understanding probabilities matters. Understanding how probability
  works is a vital underpinning to making sense of statistics - and
  statistics is a key tool to understanding how to make sense of much
  of the data that is now available to us. This can make global sense
  (much of the debate about climate change is based on statistics) and
  but also matters in more local circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm of the opinion that we are seeing &lt;a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/The-Evolving-Panorama-of-Data"&gt;an important shift in the
  role that data can play in our lives&lt;/a&gt;. For software developers, this
  means that more of our work is going to be about making sense of
  this deluge of data. An important part of this is helping people to see
  the difference between signal and noise - which is going to require
  a better understanding of the probability and statistics required to
  separate the two. As software professionals, we need to take a lead
  in this so we can fulfill our duty to avoid distorting information,
  we also need to educate consumers of our data so that they can better
  interpret it. &lt;a href="#footnote-benefit"&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="topSection"/&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FurtherReading"&gt;Further Reading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well not actually reading, but one of my favorite
      introductions to probabilistic illiteracy is &lt;a href="http://www.radiolab.org/2009/jun/15/"&gt;Stochasticity&lt;/a&gt; - a
      wonderful episode of Radiolab.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;And this gives me another opportunity to recommend &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374275637?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0374275637"&gt;Thinking Fast and
  Slow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The thing I've most appreciated from the &lt;a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;538 blog&lt;/a&gt; is how
      he discusses how his forecasting is done, including the various
      areas of uncertainty. Silver has written a &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159420411X?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=159420411X"&gt;recent book on predication models&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/&gt; - I
      haven't had chance to read it yet, but it's on my list.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Although it's 538 that been getting a lot of the attention
      lately, a couple of similar approaches are &lt;a href="http://election.princeton.edu"&gt;Princeton Election
      Consortium&lt;/a&gt; (led by Sam Wang), &lt;a href="http://research.uvu.edu/DeSart/forecasting/"&gt;DeSart and
      Holbrook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.colleyrankings.com/election2012/"&gt;Gott and
      Colley&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://votamatic.org"&gt;Drew Linzer
      (Votamatic)&lt;/a&gt;. Sam Wang has an excellent &lt;a href="http://election.princeton.edu/2012/11/04/comparisons-among-aggregators-and-modelers/"&gt;comparison
      of these models&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="#footnote-poll-models"&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list"&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-timing"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;1: &lt;/span&gt;
      I made a deliberate point of writing this before the election.
      My point being that the result doesn't affect the issues I'm
      talking about here.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-85%"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;2: &lt;/span&gt;
      This is from the &lt;a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;538 blog&lt;/a&gt; on
      Sunday November 4th. The forecast changes regularly as he
      re-runs his model with recent data. Other references to published
      forecasts also refer to that same day, when I first drafted this article.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-roll-6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;3: &lt;/span&gt;
      That is, of course, a 6-sided die. I have to say this as I'm
      sure this article is read by many people who, like myself, are
      familiar with more esoteric dice. Silver also had another
      probabilist analogy, saying it was like an &lt;a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/oct-31-obamas-electoral-college-firewall-holding-in-polls/"&gt;NFL
      team being ahead by a field goal with three minutes left to
      play.&lt;/a&gt; (I'll leave that one in for the jocks in the
      audience.)
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-test-model"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;4: &lt;/span&gt;
      I can't be bothered to figure out how many elections you'd need,
      but know enough to know that you can do this with the right
      statistical techniques - and that the answer only provides a
      probabilistic indication of confidence.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-certainty"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;5: &lt;/span&gt;
      And yes, that includes myself.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-bias"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;6: &lt;/span&gt;
      Many Republicans claim that Silver is only publishing the
      figures he gets because he is personally biased in favor of the
      Democrats. Personal bias always affects peoples' thinking, but
      there is an important difference between those who embrace their
      biases and those who strive to be objective. Silver has talked a
      lot about his model and how it works (although sadly it isn't
      open-source). There's no indication in his discussion of a
      conscious bias, indeed his odds give a &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/31/nate-silver-and-the-forecasting-consensus-in-one-chart/"&gt;higher
      chance to Romney than similar analyses&lt;/a&gt; While absolute
      objectivity is impossible, if you make the effort it is possible 
      to get closer to objectivity than just wallowing in your
      prejudices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-benefit"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;7: &lt;/span&gt;
      This may be one benefit of this controversy - more attention
      paid to these techniques, so that more people learn how they
      work and how to interpret them.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-poll-models"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;8: &lt;/span&gt;
      One counter that I've seen to all these poll-based models is
      that of &lt;a href="http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2012/10/04/updated-election-forecasting-model-still-points-romney-win-university"&gt;Bickers and Berry&lt;/a&gt;, which predicted a Romney
      victory. They don't use polls, but base their model on economic
      fundamentals. Their prediction jives well with my instinct - I
      confidently predicted that Obama would be a one-term president
      from the day he was elected. This prediction wasn't due to
      anything he might do, but just because he was elected too soon
      in the economic cycle for the economy to improve enough before
      2012 for him to have a chance of being re-elected. If he does
      get re-elected, contrary to Bickers and Berry, I would
      argue that this suggests the Republicans have badly misplayed a
      winning hand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Bliki: TransMediaApplication</title>
    <link href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TransMediaApplication.html"/>
    <updated>2012-11-01T09:52:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TransMediaApplication.html</id>
    <category term="bliki"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Mobile applications have been a hot item in software development
  over the past couple of years. Like many software delivery
  companies, ThoughtWorks get a lot of requests from clients asking us
  to build a mobile application for them. However most of the time a
  company asks us (or anyone) to build a mobile application they are
  starting off on the wrong foot. I'd argue that for most situations,
  even though you want users to interact with a mobile device, 
  you should &lt;b&gt;never think of building a mobile application&lt;/b&gt;.
  Instead you need to think about building a single application that presents
  across multiple devices: mobile, desktop, tablet - or whatever
  device your users might use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="photo" style="width: 500px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/transDeviceApp/app-per-device.png" width="500px"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;
    A common mistake is to think of different apps for different
    delivery devices.
  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="photo" style="width: 500px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/transDeviceApp/trans-app.png" width="500px"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;
    Instead think of a single app with different presentations on
    different devices.
  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine I'm using an app to find cool bars. There are many
  contexts in which I could use such an application: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sitting in a coffee shop for breakfast, figuring out on my
    tablet where I'm
    going to meet my friends this evening. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;editing my photos at my desk &lt;a href="#footnote-desktop"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; I see a picture of a really good
    bar I want to recommend to someone, so I access the application for
    information that I then email off with the photo&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;it's five-thirty, I've had a long meeting, and I'm walking the
    streets looking for a nearby bar on my phone.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I'm at home, with some friends, and we're exploring bar options
    for later on my ginormous flat screen tv.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these cases what I'm trying to do is interact with some
   notional application, but I'm doing so through very different devices
   in very different contexts. Despite this, however, I don't want to
   see these as separate applications, but as different presentations
   of a single application. Ideally I could swap between them even in
   a single context (I don't know how to find bars near me on the
   web site on my laptop, so it's quicker to do it the way I normally do on
   the phone than look up the help docs.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's a consumer case, but the same thinking applies for
  in-house applications. If I'm a retail store manager I may do some
  stock checking by prowling the aisles with a tablet, but do other
  stock management work at my desk where I have a bigger monitor and
  keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, what counts here is the user experience, it's about how
  software helps the user achieve their desires better.The user just
  wants that &lt;a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/02/its_the_stupid.html"&gt;"I
  Rule"&lt;/a&gt; moment. The fact that the company commissioning the
  software wants to send out the web site and mobile app to different
  software houses is less relevant than 1923's baseball scores. So the
  user goes elsewhere and the app provider is a victim of the &lt;a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1946001"&gt;shattered
  future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's as though the single screens of yesterday have been
    shattered and the shards have been embedded into our pockets, our
    environment, and the products we use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="quote-attribution"&gt;-- &lt;a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1946001"&gt; Jonny LeRoy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such transmedia thinking &lt;a href="#footnote-transmedia"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; goes beyond the common
  phone/web/tablet devices. Back in 2005 when Tim O'Reilly launched
  the Web 2.0 meme, one his patterns for the next generation of
  software was &lt;a href="http://oreilly.com/pub/a/web2/archive/what-is-web-20.html?page=4"&gt;Software
  Above the Level of a Single Device&lt;/a&gt;. His exemplar for this was
  the iPod, whose success was partly due to how "This application
  seamlessly reaches from the handheld device to a massive web
  back-end, with the PC acting as a local cache and control station"
  The product wasn't just the iPod, it was the iPod plus iTunes
  combination. Todays leading exemplar might be Netflix, which is a
  product you habitually use in a transmedia manner - with many
  different devices allowing you to see your movies on a TV, including
  one of which involves the post office as a data transport medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last point should remind us that transmedia thinking is in
  many ways just basic systems analysis. When doing analysis work for
  a software project, the point is to look at the overall domain
  process and consider how software can best support it. The
  transmedia label helps remind us that software can pop up in all
  sorts of places where we might not consider it before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important of part envisioning a transmedia application is that
  each device is used in different contexts to do different things. As
  a result the experience needs to designed with these contexts in
  mind - both in being aware of the different contexts and thinking
  about how they flow together. If you're looking for bar on your
  phone, you're much more likely to want to know nearby bars than if
  you're going through the website on your desk. If you're interacting
  with a travel management application, it should be able to tell that
  you're accessing via a phone, you're in your connecting airport
  between two flights, and thus make it easy for you to see how long
  you have to get to your connecting flight and how to get to the
  gate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I consider the desire to create a mobile application
  to be a Wrong Thought. It immediately frames the mobile application
  as something separate from the web site, as is the thinking that
  you're building just a web site. Instead you need to start
  with the user, figuring out what it is that they want to do and how
  software can help them do that. When thinking about this everyone
  needs to be thinking in a transmedia manner - and by everyone I
  mean all parts of the work: user experience, software architecture,
  project management&#x2026;. The application, and the project team that
  builds it, need to be thought of as a single whole, all dedicated to
  making their users happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Kelly Sommers (kellabyte) &lt;a href="http://kellabyte.com/2012/04/06/creating-boundless-experiences-with-continuous-client-and-transmedia"&gt;provides
      an example&lt;/a&gt; what a transmedia application might look like.
      This article also explores the notion of transmedia storytelling with
      some interesting links and videos.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Joshua Topolsky coined the term &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/05/26/a-modest-proposal-the-continuous-client/"&gt;Continuous
      Client&lt;/a&gt; which is a similar concept &lt;a href="#footnote-continuous-client"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;, Kelly Sommers also has a
      post with thoughts about &lt;a href="http://kellabyte.com/2011/06/26/continuous-client-my-first-attempt-at-multi-device-user-experience-transitions/"&gt;implementing
      a continuous client&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Google produced a research report on &lt;a href="http://googlemobileads.blogspot.com/2012/08/navigating-new-multi-screen-world.html"&gt;navigating the new
      multi-screen world&lt;/a&gt;, which is their thinking on the transmedia
      application.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Jonny LeRoy wrote a couple of articles on &lt;a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1946001"&gt;surviving the
      shattered future&lt;/a&gt;, talking about the challenges in a world where
      users want to use different media to interact.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;This is a bit of a tangent, but there is a good argument
      that &lt;a href="http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/content/stop-designing-&amp;#x201C;users&amp;#x201D;"&gt;we shouldn't be focusing the user experience design on a
      user so much as on an activity system&lt;/a&gt;. This suggests the
      thought that the activity system should be the target of the
      transmedia thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list"&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-desktop"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;1: &lt;/span&gt;
      A lot of people I talk to these days think the desktop is fast
      dying and that in time all our computer usage will be using
      tablets or mobiles. But I like working at a desk. When we bought
      our house I ensured we installed an ethernet jack on the porch
      so I could do my email on a laptop (this was before wireless).
      And for several years I'd use my laptop like this for a good
      chunk of time. But eventually I found it too limiting to work
      that way compared to the huge monitors on my desk. So while I
      think there's an increasing role for tablets and other devices,
      I still think the desktop will remain an important environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-transmedia"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;2: &lt;/span&gt;
      The term "transmedia" comes from the concept of transmedia storytelling
      which is all about telling a single story that
      uses different media: film, comics, games etc. This is &lt;a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1745746/seven-myths-about-transmedia-storytelling-debunked"&gt;different
      to using different representations of the same story&lt;/a&gt;, such
      as novelizations, in that the different media are intended to be
      woven into a single whole. This is why I think that "transmedia"
      is a good term to appropriate for this kind of application. (My
      thanks to Kyle Hodgson for introducing me to the transmedia
      meme.)
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-continuous-client"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;3: &lt;/span&gt;
      Although continuous client is clearly a very similar concept, I
      do see a distinction in that I can imagine applications that are
      designed and experienced as separate applications supporting
      continuous client behavior by coordinating on how they do
      hand-offs between each other. The result would be an effective
      continuous client, but not a holistic transmedia application.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <category term="bliki"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe
    that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at
    the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and
    the situation at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="quote-attribution"&gt;-- &lt;a href="http://www.retrospectives.com/pages/retroPrimeDirective.html"&gt;Norm Kerth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Retrospective Prime Directive is an important part of
  retrospective practice, and has been in integral part of
  retrospective thinking since Norm Kerth first launched the practice.
  Recently I read &lt;a href="https://leanpub.com/the-retrospective-handbook"&gt;Pat Kua's
   new
  Retrospective Handbook&lt;/a&gt;, which is based on the extensive experience
  with retros that Pat has had as a tech lead at ThoughtWorks. I find Pat's
  advice for the Prime Directive revolting, yet have to say he's
  almost certainly correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His advice is simple: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my view, every retrospective should start with the Prime
    Directive being read out, exactly as it has been worded. I know
    some agile teams that regularly run retrospectives and choose to
    skip it in favor of delving into the other phases, but in my
    experience, this tends to result in less valuable retrospective
    outputs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This advice is true for agile teams running heartbeat
    retrospectives: start the meeting by reading out the Prime
    Directive. Whoever reads it out should do so as enthusiastically
    as possible and, even better, leave it hanging in the room to give
    participants a visible reminder of the statement&#x2019;s powerful
    potential. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://leanpub.com/the-retrospective-handbook"&gt;Pat Kua's
  handbook&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent, short guide to running
  retrospectives&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of advice generates in me a feeling of deep revulsion.
  Immediately it brings to mind images of motivational posters, school
  prayers, and &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4zYlOU7Fpk"&gt;two-minutes hate&lt;/a&gt;.
  Empty rituals, designed to quench curiosity and innovation, presided
  over by those whose minds are too empty to share my distaste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet there's significant evidence that a ritual like this can
  supply real benefits, supporting Pat's positive experiences. In
  psychology there is a phenomenon called &lt;b&gt;priming&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an experiment that became an instant classic, the
    psychologist John Bargh and his collaborators asked students at
    New York University&#x2014;most aged eighteen to twenty-two&#x2014;to assemble
    four-word sentences from a set of five words (for example, &#x201C;finds
    he it yellow instantly&#x201D;). For one group of students, half the
    scrambled sentences contained words associated with the elderly,
    such as Florida, forgetful, bald, gray, or wrinkle. When they had
    completed that task, the young participants were sent out to do
    another experiment in an office down the hall. That short walk was
    what the experiment was about. The researchers unobtrusively
    measured the time it took people to get from one end of the
    corridor to the other. As Bargh had predicted, the young people
    who had fashioned a sentence from words with an elderly theme
    walked down the hallway significantly more slowly than the
    others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="quote-attribution"&gt;-- Daniel Kahneman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above quote comes from one of my favorite recent reads,
  Daniel Kahneman's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374275637?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0374275637"&gt;Thinking Fast and
  Slow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/&gt;. The book focuses on the many ways our mind can be
  fooled by jumping to incorrect intuitive conclusions. With priming
  what happens is that the mind can be primed into a state that tilts
  outcomes. Kahneman also reports experiments which have suggested
  that priming with associations of money can lead to increased
  self-reliance and selfishness; and "reminding people of their
  mortality increases the appeal of authoritarian ideas". A recent
  experiment suggested that a simple &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/11/25/15-minute-writing-exercise-closes-the-gender-gap-in-university-level-physics/"&gt;fifteen
  minute writing exercise&lt;/a&gt; about personal values could
  significantly improved the performance of women in physics
  examinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faced with this evidence on the power of priming &lt;a href="#footnote-contrary"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, it seems likely
  that focusing attention on the Prime Directive could well be priming
  people to take that more open and understanding frame of mind that's
  essential for a good retrospective. So however much I hate it, I
  should just bite my tongue and put up with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list"&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-contrary"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;1: &lt;/span&gt;
      There are some question marks over priming. Firstly there is the
      point that almost all these modern psychological experiments are
      done on students; and it may be that young, affluent, and
      intelligent westerners don't react the same as all of humanity.
      Secondly there have been concerns about problems with &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/replication-studies-bad-copy-1.10634"&gt;replication&lt;/a&gt;
      in many of these studies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bliki: gotoAarhus2012</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;The last couple of months have been heavy on the travel (towards
  the end of it I calculated that I'd spent 40 out of the last 44 days
  on the road) which is why my website has been quiet. Now I'm back
  home again and can reflect on some of it -  and the &lt;a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2012"&gt;goto conference&lt;/a&gt; is
  always full of things to reflect on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goto/infoQ conferences put a lot of &lt;a href="/bliki/DatabaseThaw.html"&gt;emphasis on new
  thinking on data before they became fashionable&lt;/a&gt;, so again there
  was quite a bit of that this year. There were a couple of tracks
  that focused heavily on NoSQL technologies, one gave a quick tour of
  many leading NoSQL databases, another concentrated on their
  applications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="photo" style="width: 250px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/gotoAarhus2012/cockcroft.jpg" width="250px"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Adrian Cockcroft
  shared many lessons that Netflix has learned in building its
  computer infrastructure.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The large scale usage of Cassandra by Netflix was particularly
  interesting and I want to take a moment to show my appreciation for
  the openness of Netflix in sharing their lessons and tools. Too
  often our profession's progress has been held back by secrecy that's
  born more out of vanity than any real competitive advantage. Netflix
  is a delightful example of companies that are both pushing the boundaries and
  sharing their tools as they go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed the &lt;a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/The-Evolving-Panorama-of-Data"&gt;new
  data panorama&lt;/a&gt; was a theme in my travels beyond just goto. Many
  of my colleagues are exploring the possibilities both in their
  client work and in the spare time. It's the bit of computing that
  I'm finding most compelling at the moment, with lots of
  opportunities to explore new techniques and find new ways for
  software to improve the work of its users. It also provides an
  opportunity to push back against the sad tendency to see developers
  as a passive recipient of requirements. Many of the opportunities
  offerred by the new data world can only be seen by those closer to
  the technology, so I'm hoping this could tilt us back towards
  &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ConversationalStories.html"&gt;ConversationalStories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="photo" style="width: 250px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/gotoAarhus2012/hanselman.jpg" width="250px"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Scott
  Hanselman talked about cloud servers, the power of javascript,
  and by implication the example of a more open Microsoft&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another theme that struck me was the growing centrality of
  javascript. Scott Hanselman's keynote featured a showcase of
  unlikely ways in which javascript, running in a browser, is doing
   things that many people find surprising.  And, of course,
  there was &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dqZW_DqHIQ"&gt;Anders Hejlsberg's closing keynote&lt;/a&gt;, with another approach
  to taming the monstrous complexities of javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to tease colleagues who are delving into modern,
  sophisticated languages like Clojure, F#, and Scala by claiming that
  Javascript is the only language of the future. While it's fun to
  pull peoples' chains, it's not a cheerful thought - I'm one of those
  who despairs that a language with such deep flaws plays such an
  important role in computation. Still the consequence of this is that
  we must take &lt;a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/sites/www.thoughtworks.com/files/files/technology-radar-jan-2010.pdf"&gt;javascript
  seriously as a first-class language&lt;/a&gt; and concentrate on how to
  limit the damage its flaws cause. There's a lot to like in
  Microsoft's TypeScript approach, and it's something I can easily see
  myself using over the next few months - where I'm hoping to get more
  time to spend on work that will involve more javascript than any
  sane person would like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="photo" style="width: 500px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/gotoAarhus2012/hejlsberg.jpg" width="500px"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anders
  Hejlsberg's keynote was the second successive year where a keynote
  at goto talked about an important technology to fix the flaws of
  javascript&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javascript was one common theme to Scott and Anders's talks, but
  there was another element that was every bit as important. Back in
  2007 I wrote about how &lt;a href="/bliki/RubyMicrosoft.html"&gt;Microsoft had
  struggled to co-exist with the open-source world&lt;/a&gt;. I later
  learned that my little article had set off a small tempest, with
  various Microsoft managers denouncing my criticism and labeling me
  an irredeemable enemy. Such a reaction was discouraging but
  fortunately other, stronger, forces were in play. Both Scott's
  colleagues in the ASP.NET / Azure worlds and the TypeScript team
  have a degree of openness which would seem shocking just a few years
  ago. TypeScript is &lt;a href="http://typescript.codeplex.com"&gt;sitting on codeplex&lt;/a&gt;, and
  implemented in itself so is as easy to run on Macs and open-source
  unixen as it is on Windows. My sense is that Microsoft is very much
  a factional organization, with many factions still deeply inimical
  to the open-source world, but with such large factions now working
  on coexistence with open-source, many developers with a long
  standing distrust of the Evil Empire should be reconsidering where
  to direct their suspicions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another speaker who talked about the browser-centered future was
  Dan North, who gave a wildly entertaining performance to a packed
  room on the evolution of browser applications. During this he
  indicated how little he cared about the many developments of
  graphics; while I mostly share his insouciance I will disagree over
  one technology: SVG. SVG is more than a standard to get vector
  graphics on the web, the more important impact of SVG is that it
  creates vector shapes as elements in the DOM, where they can be
  accessed by javascript and CSS. This I think is a profound shift.
  You can see one consequence of this by perusing the &lt;a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery"&gt;d3 gallery&lt;/a&gt;, where
  you can see how this rethinks the world of data visualization. At
  the moment the web is still a world of static text and images, with
  video present but essentially alien. SVG opens up a toolbox for
  animation and interactivity which I'm thinking could imply a big
  difference to how we use the browser for both application UIs and
  publications.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class = 'img'&gt;&lt;img src = 'http://martinfowler.com/snips/calatrava-logo.png' width = '150' height = '' alt = '' title = ''/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago I wrote an &lt;a href='http://martinfowler.com/articles/multiMobile'&gt;infodeck about developing mobile applications for multiple devices&lt;/a&gt;. A core point of the deck is that for the best user-experience you need several native applications, but this is expensive. To reduce cost a mobile web application works on all suitable devices, but a web-app limits your user-interface. The result is an unavoidable choice between user-experience and cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we can&amp;#8217;t make that trade-off go away, we can turn a binary choice into a more graduated scale by developing hybrid applications that mix web and native technologies. At ThoughtWorks we&amp;#8217;ve been pursuing this path on various client projects, with some success. We&amp;#8217;ve now developed enough understanding on how to approach a hybrid application to make it worth sharing some code, so we recently released Calatrava, which is a framework to enable this web-native interoperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calatrava is suitable for applications with significant client-side domain logic and when the application a channel for your product rather than the product itself. It is not suitable if most of your code is UI code (such as a game) or if a web app provides a sufficiently good user-experience. Calatrava is probably most valuable when you want to pursue an incremental release strategy, such as &lt;a href='http://martinfowler.com/articles/mobileImplStrategy.html#cover-your-bases'&gt;cover-your-bases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information look at the &lt;a href='http://calatrava.github.com/'&gt;calatrava home page on github&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href='http://overwatering.org/blog/2012/10/announcing-calatrava/'&gt;launch announcement by maintainer Giles Alexander&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;#8217;s also an overview on a &lt;a href='http://martinfowler.com/articles/multiMobile/#calatrava'&gt;single infodeck slide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Mountain Lion and Nokogiri</title>

    <category term=""/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today was the day I attempted the upgrade to Mountain Lion. Upgrading all the way from Snow Leopard (long story). The tedious first step is making sure I have backups, usually multiple backups, in addition to the ones I keep by default. Computers hate me, so I&amp;#8217;ve learned to be paranoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first serious hitch was with Aperture. I&amp;#8217;d bought a download ages ago, when the route was to download a trial version and buy a product key. I still have the key, but there&amp;#8217;s no place to download the trial version from. Fortunately there was a very helpful man on Apple&amp;#8217;s telephone support who solved that one. +1 to him for being so helpful, but -2 for Apple for making it hard in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My more serious trouble was with Nokogiri, ruby&amp;#8217;s XML processing library. Since almost all my website is XML transformed to HTML via Nokogiri and Ruby, this is rather crucial to me. But I had no end of trouble finding some way to get Nokogiri to install and work. Looking out on the web there are several pages of advice, with different combinations of animals to sacrifice in various orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I got it working, but not in such a way that I have a confident trail for others to follow. I installed XCode command line tools, later the full XCode itself (don&amp;#8217;t know if that was a factor). I initially used homebrew for supporting libraries but without success. I tried using rvm, but it failed (and I backed it out). In the end I installed libxml2 and libxslt using Macports and got it all working on the installed ruby 1.8.7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can only hope that this is just early days of Mountain Lion, but the situation is really too messy. It&amp;#8217;s very troubling that the default install of ruby is still the elderly 1.8.7. I do need to share my scripts from time to time with others who are not active rubyists. It would be nice if there was a simpler installation process for them than my worry-ridden afternoon. I find myself pining for the days of the one-click windows install.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

They have spent many years helping organizations explore agile development and I&amp;#8217;ve always found their opinions worth listening to. When I get requests to review articles I rarely have time to read them, but a recent request by this pair piqued my interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I read their draft on the stages of agile fluency, I immediately offerred to publish it on my site. The article looks at how teams pass through four stages of fluency with agile methods. Each stage brings benefits, but demands investment. Not all teams should go through all the stages. The model they&amp;#8217;ve come up with is nicely simple and resonates with tales told by my colleagues. I think it provides a good framework for thinking about the style of agile development you are at and where you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Retreaded: RigorousAgile</title>
    <link href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/RigorousAgile.html"/>
    <updated>2012-07-26T15:24:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>tag:martinfowler.com,2012-07-26:Retreaded--RigorousAgile</id>
    <category term=""/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p class = 'original'&gt;&lt;a href = 'http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Retread.html'&gt;Retread&lt;/a&gt; of post orginally made on 29 May 2005&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often run into a complaint that agile methods don't have a
	rigorous definition. The complainer may talk about how this means
	that you can't tell if a particular team is using an agile method or
	not. They may also say that this makes it hard to teach people how
	to do agile methods - what's the curriculum?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To some degree I do feel the pain of this complaint - but
	I accept there is no cure. This lack of rigorousness is part of the
	defining nature of agile methods, part of its core philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the fundamental problems of thought processes in general -
and of software development in particular - is the very varied nature
of the settings. Different kinds of systems have different kinds of
pressures and forces, which makes it very difficult to come up with a
rigorous statement of what to do that's sufficient to cover them. This
effect is compounded by the fact that software development is such a
people-oriented activity, and people are naturally &lt;a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Characterizing+people+as+non-linear%2c+first-order+components+in+software+development"&gt;inconsistent

and highly variable&lt;/a&gt;. The conclusion that agilists made from this
is that's its not effective to try and bind software development to a
rigorous process, because that's ignoring the essential nature of the
primary (human) components that will execute that process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(It's probably because our profession is to work with computers
	is what leads us to want to program human systems the same way that
	we program computers - despite the fact that they are so different.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upshot of all this is that agile methods fundamentally expect
	teams to decide what process to follow and furthermore expect teams
	to actively and regularly change their process. Any attempt to
	define a rigorous process that can be tested for conformance runs
	contrary to this philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't deny that this is frustrating. How can you do a survey on
	whether agile methods are more effective that alternatives, or
	whether Extreme Programming is more effective than Scrum, when you
	can't get a clear definition of what Scrum is in the first place? If
	a client wants a system built using Extreme Programming how can they
	tell if it's really being done?. There is a sense of "I know it when
	I see it",  but it requires an
	experienced practitioner to have that sense and even then there's
	lots of room for such practitioners to disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't have an answer to this conundrum. Indeed I don't think
	there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; an answer. It's a an unfortunate consequence of the
	activity itself, just as getting wet is an unavoidable consequence
	of swimming.&lt;/p&gt;

So I&amp;#8217;m late in mentioning that &lt;a href='http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321826620'&gt;NoSQL Distilled is now available for pre-order on InformIT&lt;/a&gt;. Its ship date is August 17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you pre-order you can get 35% off by entering discount code FOWLER6626 during checkout (this offer expires on August 17). InformIT is also running an offer where you get a 30 day trial to Safari Books Online if you place an order on InformIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book has now completed production and has gone off to the printers. As I understand it the final ebook will appear when the printed book appears on August 17. Until then Safari subscribers can still read the &lt;a href='http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9780133036138'&gt;rough cut&lt;/a&gt;, which includes the copy-edited text, but lacks the final layout and index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final book has 172 pages, which is sadly longer than we&amp;#8217;d hoped. We hope you&amp;#8217;ll forgive us for that.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Retreaded: SemanticDiffusion</title>

&lt;p class = 'original'&gt;&lt;a href = 'http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Retread.html'&gt;Retread&lt;/a&gt; of post orginally made on 14 Dec 2006&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the habit of creating &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Neologism.html"&gt;Neologism&lt;/a&gt;s to describe
the things I see in software development. It's a common habit amongst
writers in this field, for software development still lacks much useful
jargon. One of the problems with building a jargon is that terms
are vulnerable to losing their meaning, in a process of
semantic diffusion - to use yet another potential addition to our
jargon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semantic diffusion occurs when you have a word that is coined a
	person or group, often with a pretty good definition, but then gets
	spread through the wider community in a way that weakens that
	definition. This weakening risks losing the definition entirely -
	and with it any usefulness to the term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm partly prompted to write this because I see this semantic
	diffusion happening very publicly to
	two terms at the moment: 'agile' and '&lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Web2.0.html"&gt;Web2.0&lt;/a&gt;'. Both were coined in the
	last few years and both come with lengthy definitions. (Agile has
	the &lt;a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/"&gt;agile manifesto&lt;/a&gt;,
	together with numerous books and &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html"&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; by
	the authors of the manifesto. Web 2.0 has an excellent &lt;a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html"&gt;definitional
	article&lt;/a&gt; by Tim O'Reilly.) Yet both of these face a lot of corruption
	in the field. I've run into people who think agile methods mean you
	shouldn't do any planning and those who think Web 2.0 is solely
	about using AJAX. (A more personal case is &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/RefactoringMalapropism.html"&gt;RefactoringMalapropism&lt;/a&gt;,
	but I'll leave that aside for the moment.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semantic diffusion is essentially a succession of Chinese
whispers where a different group of people to the originators of a
term  start talking about it without being careful about following the
original definition. These people are listened to by a further group
which then goes on to add their own distortions. After a few of these
hand-offs it's easy to lose a lot of the key meaning of the term
unless you make the point of going back to the originators. It's
ironic that it's popular terms that tend to suffer from this the most.
That's inevitable, of course, since unpopular terms have less people
to create the Chinese whisper chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semantic diffusion tends to coincide with hype phase of an idea.
As an idea becomes attractive, lots of people are... well... attracted. Many
of these followers talk about the term and teach about it.  If these
people aren't careful to go back to the source, the Chinese whispers
begin. Popular ideas also spread primarily though communication media
that are more likely to lead to misunderstanding - such as
writing. Many followers aren't fortunate enough to work directly with
the originators and thus learn directly from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related indicator to popularity is desirability. A word that
sounds good may be more likely to suffer from semantic diffusion.
'Agile' sounds like something you'd certainly want to be, the antonyms
of agile aren't at all appealing. Who would want to still be merely
1.0 of the web? Kent Beck noticed this effect and thus deliberately
picked Extreme Programming as a name because it less inherently
desirable: 'extreme' is often used as a pejorative. Using a less
desirable term may reduce semantic diffusion, but I don't think it
avoids the problem completely. After all we saw semantic diffusion
occur to 'object-oriented' which is a neutral term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semantic diffusion is more likely to occur with things that are
	broad concepts rather than hard technologies. Ruby on Rails is
	getting a lot of hype at the moment, but since it's a concrete tool
	it's hard for its meaning to weaken. Extreme Programming's list of
	concrete practices may also reduce this problem compared to agile's
	broader list of values and principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semantic diffusion is a painful process to watch, particularly
	for those who find the ideas useful. At the moment I see signs of despair
	for both of these terms, some people in the agile world are talking
	of ditching the word agile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm more sanguine about all this, largely because I've seen it
before. There was a time when almost any software tool or method was
described as object-oriented. But now, years later, the essential
meaning of OO is reasonably well understood. I saw the same thing
happen with patterns. So terms do recover their semantic integrity and
the current diffusion doesn't inevitably mean the terms will lose
their meaning. I'm also less worried about it because I expected it,
again having gone through this process before. I think it's an
inevitable consequence of ideas becoming popular and despite its
problems, I prefer the hype to ignorance. A final comforting thought
is that once the equally inevitable backlash comes we get a refocusing
on the original meaning. As I'm writing this I'm comforted by the fact
that I can't think of a
term that lost its meaning entirely, although I'm sure it's happened.
(SOA doesn't count, as I don't think there ever was a commonly agreed
meaning for that to start with.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the eventual outcome we still have to cope with semantic
diffusion as it happens. One option is abandonment, to drop the
diffuse term and pick a new one. I don't like this option because a
new term only adds to the confusion and even if you're successful you just
end up repeating the process for the new term. So my preference is to keep
re-articulating the current terminology, pointing to those who
understand the true meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further complication is that these terms also shift. I'm sure
if you asked the original seventeen authors of the agile manifesto,
they would come up with a different document today. (Let alone the
fact that that group wouldn't be the best group to speak for the
movement today.) Again it's a responsibility for those who are
identified as originators to point this out, both by talking about the
way the ideas evolve and by pointing to new people who are playing an
active role in that evolution. (I'm pleased that the original
seventeen &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/agileStory.html"&gt;"let the ship
sail"&lt;/a&gt; to go its own way.) Let's not forget there's a tricky
balance between holding to a clear definition and dogmatism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is hard work, but a good term is worth fighting for -
particularly since the only bullets you need are words.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#8217;m extra-pleased this time, because it gives me the chance to highlight some valuable software development techniques that I feel are particularly under-used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we first started using agile methods at the beginning of this century, one of our biggest questions was how to handle database design in an agile way. Fortunately we had Pramod Sadalage around, a DBA who was determined to find a way to incorporate databases with the agile working style. He developed a set of techniques, including regular database refactoring and scripted migrations that are version-controlled with application code. These techniques have now becomes habitual for ThoughtWorks but have not been as widely adopted in the industry as I believe they should. This podcast provides an hour or so that outlines how this all works, which I&amp;#8217;m hoping will encourage greater usage of them.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p class = 'original'&gt;&lt;a href = 'http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Retread.html'&gt;Retread&lt;/a&gt; of post orginally made on 14 Nov 2008&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's imagine a pretty world of SOA-happiness where the computing
  needs of an enterprise are split into many small applications that
  provide services to each other to allow effective collaboration. One
  fine morning a consumer service needs some information from a supplier
  service. The twist is that although the supplier service has the
  necessary data and processing logic to get this information, it
  doesn't yet expose that information through a service interface. The
  supplier has a potential service, but it isn't actually there yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world the developers of the consumer service just asks
  the supplier service to develop the potential service and all is
  dandy. But life is not ideal - the sticking point here is that the
  developers of the supplier service have other things to do, usually
  things that are more important to their customer and management than
  helping out the consumer service team. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I was chatting with my colleague Erik D&#xF6;rnenburg and he
  told me about an approach he saw a client use to deal with
  this problem. They took a leaf out of the open source play-book and
  made all their services into internal open source systems. This
  allows consumer service developers write the service themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure many readers are rolling their eyes at the visions of
  chaos this would cause, but just as open source projects don't allow
  just anyone to edit anything; this client uses open-source-style control
  mechanisms. In particular each service has a couple of custodians -
  people whose responsibility it is to keep the service in a healthy
  state. In the normal course of events the consumer developer wouldn't
  actually commit changes to the supplier source tree directly,
  instead they send a patch to the custodian. Just like an open-source
  maintainer, the custodian receives the patch and reviews it to see
  if it's good enough to commit. If not there's a dialog with the
  consumer developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Erik knows well from &lt;a href="http://erik.doernenburg.com/open-source-projects/"&gt;his own open
  source work&lt;/a&gt;, reviewing a patch is much less effort than making
  a change yourself. So although the custodian approach doesn't
  entirely eliminate the problem of consumer developers needing to wait
  on supplier developers, it does a lot to reduce the difficulty. And
  again following the open-source model, a consumer developer can be
  made a committer once the custodians are comfortable. This
  still means that commits can get reviewed by the custodians, but avoids
  the custodians becoming a bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to this was their approach to a service registry. We've
  seen a lot of fancy products being sold to provide service registry
  capabilities so that people can lookup services and see how to use
  them. This client discarded them and used a
  &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/HumaneRegistry.html"&gt;HumaneRegistry&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class = 'original'&gt;&lt;a href = 'http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Retread.html'&gt;Retread&lt;/a&gt; of post orginally made on 06 Sep 2004&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've heard a couple of questions recently about coming up with a
	standard story point mechanism for multiple teams using extreme
	programming's planning approach. The hope is have several teams all
	using equivalent story points, so that three story points of effort
	on one team is the same as on another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think trying to come up with this at best of limited value, and
	at worst dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The estimating system of extreme programming is based on
		&lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/XpVelocity.html"&gt;XpVelocity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/YesterdaysWeather.html"&gt;YesterdaysWeather&lt;/a&gt;. Inherent
		in this is the idea that when you make estimates, the actual units
		you estimate aren't important - what's important is you estimate
		by rough comparative value and use &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/YesterdaysWeather.html"&gt;YesterdaysWeather&lt;/a&gt;
		for calibration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this situation the story points act as an anchor for the
		feedback loop that Yesterday's Weather provides - nothing more.
		Baked into them are all sorts of assumptions about the nature of
		the team's task, the capability of the team, and whether the team
		are optimistic or pessimistic estimators. Once you try to come up
		with a standard across teams you are trying to normalize all of
		these factors. Trying to do this sounds very hard to me, and I'm
		not aware of anyone who has done this effectively. This doesn't
		mean its impossible, it just means it's hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dangerous aspect comes from once you have a standard unit for
	measurement across teams, someone is inevitably going to use it to
	compare the performance of teams. Even if everyone swears till they
	are blue in the face that they won't use it for cross team
	measurement, there will always be the suspicion that this will
	happen eventually. This will cause teams to distort their
	measurements so that it seems that they get more story points
	done. My fear is that this will break the feedback loop of
	yesterday's weather and knock the planning process off kilter. I'm
	always suspicious about these things because while it would be
	incredibly valuable to have a way to measure productivity I think
		the nature of software is such that we &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CannotMeasureProductivity.html"&gt;CannotMeasureProductivity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to be worth trying, this has to yield some valuable benefits -
	but I don't see any. One reason that I've heard is to help people
	move onto teams and estimate more quickly. But you can't estimate on
	a new team until you get reasonably familiar with the problem and
	the current code base. As you do that you'll also get a feel for the
	relative sizes of story points on that team. We move people around
	between projects at ThoughtWorks and I've never heard anyone
	complain about difficulty of estimating when coming onto a new team
	due to differences in story points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Published Interface&lt;/i&gt; is a term I used (first in &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html"&gt;Refactoring&lt;/a&gt;)
to refer to a class interface that's used outside the code base that
it's defined in. As such it means more than public in Java and indeed
even more than a non-internal public in C#. In my column for IEEE
Software I argued
that &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/published.pdf"&gt;the distinction between published and public is actually more
important than that between public and private.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is that with a non-published interface you can change
it and update the calling code since it is all within a single code
base. Such things as renames can be done, and done easily with modern
refactoring tools. But anything published so you can't reach the
calling code needs more complicated treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class = 'original'&gt;&lt;a href = 'http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Retread.html'&gt;Retread&lt;/a&gt; of post orginally made on 28 Jul 2006&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone is looking at what makes up a top-class enterprise
	software developer, often the conversation may turn to knowledge of
	frameworks and languages, or perhaps the ability to understand
	complicated algorithms and data structures. For me, one of the most
	important traits in a programmer, or indeed in a development team,
	is something that I'll call Customer Affinity. This is the interest
	and closeness that the developers have in the business problem that
	the software is addressing, and in the people who live in that
	business world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many aspects to customer affinity. The first one is
	just the interest in the business, its processes and rules. I've
	always been fascinated by domains I've worked in: health care,
	derivatives, payroll, leasing - are all examples of really
	interesting domain problems with a lot of complexity that has to be
	organized and understood. For me aspects of a project such as
	object-relational mapping, remote process communication - what I
	think of as the plumbing of enterprise systems, don't have that same
	interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important that a team has the plumbing working and under
control, but I believe that the more energy goes into the business
problem, the more effective at providing value a team will be. Which
is a good reason to use frameworks that solve and simplify as much of
the plumbing as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of customer affinity is the ability to
	collaborate with domain experts. I don't think that detailed
	knowledge of the domain is an important thing for programmers to
	have; useful yes, but not important. What's more critical than
	knowledge is the ability to collaborate with those that have the
	knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My high regard for customer affinity is one the main reasons why
	I'm such a fan of Extreme Programming and other agile methods. I
	found it very significant that when Kent Beck summarized XP to his
	agile peers at the snowbird workshop which coined 'agile', he chose
	to describe not the technical elements of XP, but his desire to
	change the nature of the customer/developer interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've often heard this relationship mis-characterized. In
particular there is a belief in some quarters that the customer team
just comes up with stories which they throw at the developers. This
characterization is rather like the notion that requirements are just
lying out there to be gathered. Either way that's
not much of a collaboration. Instead developers need to work together
with domain people to
generate ideas with developers learning a lot about the business in
the process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Kent's suggested names for 'Agile' was
&lt;i&gt;conversational&lt;/i&gt; software development - the point being that it's
a two way communication. This isn't something like a telecoms protocol
that you can define, but the back and forth discussions about how
software can enhance the business are where the real value
lives. Much of this conversation is of half-baked ideas, some of which
grow into valuable features - often ones that aren't things that the
customer originally thought of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that frustrates me is how organizations often
	try to squelch customer affinity. It's not something people admit to
	doing, but it's a common consequence of other
	decisions. Organizational barriers can contribute to squelching -
	I've come across places where
	you have to get your manager to arrange with another manager just so
	you can have a conversation with someone on the business side. That
	hardly encourages you to get inside the workings of the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've often heard it said that enterprise software is boring, just
	shuffling data around, that people of talent will do "real" software
	that requires fancy algorithms, hardware hacks, or plenty of
	math. I feel that this usually  happens
	due to a lack of customer affinity. The real intellectual challenge
	of business software is figuring out what the real
	contribution of software can be to a business. You need both good
	technical and business knowledge to find that.  Working closely with
	business people to develop this knowledge, and
	&lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PleasingTheCustomer.html"&gt;PleasingTheCustomer&lt;/a&gt; as you do it, is  what makes
	enterprise software development fun - and motivation is the key to good
	and productive work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of bright and capable people who want to learn
	about the businesses they write software for. Too often
	organizations make it hard for them to do so. Until that changes,
	our profession will continue to under-deliver on our potential.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Progress on NoSQL Distilled</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Time for a progress report on &lt;a href='http://martinfowler.com/bliki/NosqlDistilled.html'&gt;NoSQL Distilled&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#8217;ve done a round of technical review and are now pretty happy with the text, happy enough to move it into production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Production for a book these days is both more complicated and more responsive than it used to be. The next step on the book text is to do copy-editing and indexing. It sounds like we are going to get the &lt;a href='http://www.kirsanov.com/'&gt;same people&lt;/a&gt; I worked with on &lt;a href='http://martinfowler.com/books/dsl.html'&gt;my DSL book&lt;/a&gt;, which will be excellent news since they did a good job and were happy to work directly on the XML source in my repository. This simplifies and speeds up the whole process. They will also do the book design and convert the book in camera-ready for printing the physical books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect, however, that this book will see more electronic copies than physical ones. In parallel with the copy-editing we&amp;#8217;ll be preparing the electronic copies. We intend to do a rough-cut version of the book as soon as we can. This should be available through &lt;a href='http://www.informit.com/authors/bio.aspx?a=8877bf0c-92bd-4d0d-8317-d67fe8b88eee'&gt;InformIT&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon, and &lt;a href='http://my.safaribooksonline.com'&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ll make further announcements here as these become visible.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Retreaded: SpecificationByExample</title>
    <link href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SpecificationByExample.html"/>
    <updated>2011-11-17T08:38:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>tag:martinfowler.com,2011-11-17:Retreaded--SpecificationByExample</id>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p class = 'original'&gt;&lt;a href = 'http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Retread.html'&gt;Retread&lt;/a&gt; of post orginally made on 18 Mar 2004&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was attending a workshop at XP/Agile Universe in 2002 when the
phrase 'Specification By Example' struck me as a way to describe one
of roles of testing in &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html#xp"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(These days it's terribly unfashionable to talk about Test Driven
Development (TDD) having anything to do with testing, but like &lt;a href="http://blogs.codehaus.org/people/tirsen/archives/000582_tdd_is_about_testing.html"&gt;Jon&lt;/a&gt; I do think that having a comprehensive automated test suite
is more valuable than the term 'side-effect' implies. Rather like if
someone offered me a million dollars to hike up a mountain. I may say
that the main purpose of the hike is the enjoyment of nature, but the
side-effect to my wallet is hardly trivial....)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specification By Example isn't the way most of us have been
brought up to think of specifications. Specifications are supposed to
be general, to cover all cases. Examples only highlight a few points,
you have to infer the generalizations yourself. This does mean that
Specification By Example can't be the only requirements technique you
use, but it doesn't mean that it can't take a leading role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far the dominant idea with rigorous specifications, that is
those that can be clearly judged to be passed or failed, is to use pre
and post conditions. These techniques dominate in formal methods, and
also underpin &lt;a href="http://archive.eiffel.com/doc/manuals/technology/contract/"&gt;Design

by Contract&lt;/a&gt;. These techniques have their place, but they aren't
ideal. The pre-post conditions can be very easy to write in some
situations, but others can be very tricky. I've tried to use them in a
number enterprise application settings, and I've found that in many
situations it's as hard to write the pre and post conditions as it is
to write the solution. One of the great things about specification by
example is that examples are usually much easier to come up with,
particularly for the non-nerds who we write the software for. (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201824191?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0201824191"&gt;Timothy Budd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/&gt; pointed out that while you can
show a lot of stack behavior with pre and post conditions, it's very
tricky to write pre and post conditions that show the LIFO
property.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important property of TDD tests is that they involve a
double-check. In fact this highlights an amusing little lie of the XP
community. They make a very strong point of saying things Once and
Only Once, but in fact they always say things twice: once in the code
and once in the tests. Kent has pointed out that this double-check
principle is a vital principle, and it's certainly one that humans use
all the time. The value of the double check is very much tied into
using different methods for each side of the double check. Combining
Specification By Example with production code means that you have both
things said quite differently, which increases their ability to find
errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formal specification community have constantly had trouble
verifying that a design satisfies a specification, particularly in
doing this without error prone humans. For Specification By Example,
this is easy. Another case of Specification By Example being less
valuable in theory but more valuable in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Design by Contract fan pointed out that if you write a
specification in terms of tests, then the supplier could satisfy the
specification by just returning hard-coded responses to the specific
test inputs. My flippant answer to this is that if you are concerned
about this then the issue of tests versus Design by Contract is the
least of your worries. But there is a serious point here. Tests are
always going to be incomplete, so they always have to be backed up
with other mechanisms. Being the twisted mind that I am, I actually
see this as a plus. Since it's clear that Specification By Example
isn't enough, it's clear that you need to do more to ensure that
everything is properly communicated. One of the most dangerous things
about a traditional requirements specification is when people think
that once they've written it they are done communicating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specification By Example only works in the context of a working
relationship where both sides are collaborating and not fighting. The
examples trigger abstractions in the design team while keeping the
abstractions grounded. You do need more - things like regular
conversation, techniques like &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321125215?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321125215"&gt;Domain Driven
Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/&gt;, indeed even doses of Design by Contract. While I've
never had the opportunity to use Design by Contract fully (i.e. with
Eiffel) I regularly think about interfaces in contractual terms.
Specification By Example is a powerful tool, perhaps my most used
tool, but never my only tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(For more thinking on Specification By Example, if not by that
name, take a look at &lt;a href="http://www.exampler.com/blog/"&gt;Brian Marick's&lt;/a&gt;
writings. Somewhere on his site there probably is one super page that
sums up his view on it. Of course finding it is less valuable than
reading all the stuff there while you're trying) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="SomeLaterComments"&gt;Some Later Comments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of years after I first wrote this, there was a &lt;a href="http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000392.html"&gt;post by Cedric
	Beust&lt;/a&gt; that was critical of agile methods that
	caused a minor blog spat. There were rebuttals by &lt;a href="http://www.langrsoft.com/blog/2006/06/open-note-to-google-i-thank-google-one.html"&gt;Jeff Langr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.AgilePeopleStillDontGetIt"&gt;Bob
	Martin&lt;/a&gt;, and I sent this post through the feed again.  Jeff Langr
  later added a &lt;a href="http://www.langrsoft.com/blog/2006/06/are-tests-specs-ive-presented-tdd.html"&gt;nice
	example&lt;/a&gt; using using tests as specification by example for Java's
	Math.pow function.&lt;/p&gt;

	preliminary things on the topic. One common thing I see people do
	is to develop validation routines for objects. These routines come
	in various ways, they may be in the object or external, they may
	return a boolean or throw an exception to indicate failure. But one
	thing that I think constantly trips people up is when they think
	object validity on a context independent way such as an &lt;code&gt;isValid&lt;/code&gt;
	method implies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it's much more useful to think of validation as something
that's bound to a context - typically an action that you want to do.
Is this order valid to be filled, is this customer valid to check in
to the hotel. So rather than have methods like &lt;code&gt;isValid&lt;/code&gt;
have methods like &lt;code&gt;isValidForCheckIn&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the consequences of this is that saving an object to a
	database is itself an action. Thinking about it that way raises some
	important questions. Often when people talk about a context-free
	validity, they mean it in terms of saving to a database. But the
	various validity checks that make this up should be interrogated
	with the question "should failing this test prevent saving?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1568843224?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1568843224"&gt;About Face&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/&gt; Alan Cooper advocated that we shouldn't let
our ideas of valid states prevent a user from entering (and saving)
incomplete information. I was reminded by this a few days ago when
reading a draft of a book that &lt;a href="http://www.jnsk.se/weblog/rss.xml"&gt;Jimmy Nilsson&lt;/a&gt; is working
on. He stated a principle that you should always be able to save an
object, even if it has errors in it. While I'm not convinced that this
should be an absolute rule, I do think people tend to prevent saving
more than they ought. Thinking about the context for validation may
help prevent that.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#8217;ll be speaking, doing my usual &lt;a href='http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SuiteOfTalks.html'&gt;suite of talks&lt;/a&gt;. More importantly there&amp;#8217;s an impressive line up of my colleagues - the people whose ideas I clip and package up into those talks. So this is a great opportunity to listen to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graham and Andy talk from their experiences in the technical leadership of agile projects&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;project management lessons from Joe Z&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;hot devops and continuous delivery juice from Rolf and Jez&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Ross&amp;#8217;s advice on IT budgeting&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Linda&amp;#8217;s take on integrating UX with an agile project&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Matt on using offshore teams for agile (he played a big role in building our offshore teams)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a trio of talks on the gnarly topic of organizational change from Tiffany, Greg and Manu&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Chad explaining how to avoid the pitfalls of automated tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and a special guest in New York who will make all our talks seem pedestrian.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Retreaded: SoftwareDevelopmentAttitude</title>
    <link href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SoftwareDevelopmentAttitude.html"/>
    <updated>2011-09-08T10:04:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>tag:martinfowler.com,2011-09-08:Retreaded--SoftwareDevelopmentAttitude</id>
    <category term=""/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p class = 'original'&gt;&lt;a href = 'http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Retread.html'&gt;Retread&lt;/a&gt; of post orginally made on 08 Mar 2004&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many debates in software development are underpinned by whether
the speaker has a &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DirectingAttitude.html"&gt;DirectingAttitude&lt;/a&gt; or an
&lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/EnablingAttitude.html"&gt;EnablingAttitude&lt;/a&gt;. These different attitudes affect choices
over languages, designs, tools, processes, and lots more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's some examples of this dichotomy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A debate a while ago triggered by Joel Spolsky's post on &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2003/10/13.html"&gt;exceptions&lt;/a&gt;.

He didn't like exceptions because they could be misused badly, leading
to confusing code (directing). Bill Caputo &lt;a href="http://www.williamcaputo.com/archives/000009.html"&gt;pointed
out&lt;/a&gt; that exceptions, when used well, make life much easier
(enabling).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Some of the static/dynamic typing debate brings up these
points. Some arguments in favor of static typing talk about how they
prevent people from making certain kinds of mistake (directing) while
dynamic typers point out how static typing restricts some useful
idioms (enabling).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Agile processes are &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PeopleOriented.html"&gt;PeopleOriented&lt;/a&gt; (enabling),
while plan-driven methods seek to ensure that even a poor team can do
an acceptable job (directing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These aren't hard-wired attitudes. Often people are directing in
some cases and enabling in others. But I think there is a deep strain
running through here, often a personality issue, that runs underneath
much discussion on how we do software. (I'm very much in the enabling
category, as if you can't tell.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think that all restrictions on what a developer does
imply a directing attitude, but it's not that simple. As an example,
consider memory management. You can think of this as a directing
feature: programmers can't be trusted to manage memory correctly so
take away their ability to allocate memory. But I look at memory
management as an enabling technology - it takes away something I don't
&lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to worry about, so I can concentrate better on those
things I do care about. Steve &lt;a href="http://stevef.truemesh.com/archives/000206.html"&gt;tied this thought nicely&lt;/a&gt; onto the
difference between problems and difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

This is an excellent conference with a good range of material across both technology and process. This year I&amp;#8217;ll be participating in a pair of tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Oct 9 I&amp;#8217;ll be with Jez Humble doing our full-day tutorial on Continuous Delivery, the first time we&amp;#8217;ve brought this tutorial to Aarhus. This will cover much of the ground in Jez and Dave&amp;#8217;s award winning book including the business case for Continuous Delivery, deployment pipelines, testing strategies, version control organization, and recipes for going live. We&amp;#8217;ve had a lot of good feedback on this tutorial so far, so I&amp;#8217;m glad to finally bring this to my favorite conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Oct 13 I&amp;#8217;ll join Rebecca Parsons to talk about Evolutionary Architecture. Rebecca&amp;#8217;s long been our chief technical firefighter on difficult projects, which often have complicated dependencies to enterprise architecture. I&amp;#8217;ve long been urging her to talk more about her experiences and techniques for handling these issues, so it will be good to work with her on this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between I&amp;#8217;ll be hanging around the conference catching up on all the good pickings that will be available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If you want to register, using the discount code &amp;#8220;fowl1250&amp;#8221; will get you a worthwhile discount.)&lt;/p&gt;</content>

In 2009-10 he wrote a &lt;a href='http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-eaed1/index.html'&gt;series of fifteen articles&lt;/a&gt; for IBM developerWorks which dug deeper into the question of evolutionary architecture and design.

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the software world, we have the &lt;a href='http://drdobbs.com/joltawards'&gt;Jolt awards&lt;/a&gt;. These were originally run by Software Development magazine and are now run by Dr Dobbs magazine. My books have won a couple of &amp;#8216;productivity awards&amp;#8217; - which are essentially the runner-up awards - but I&amp;#8217;ve never snagged to top award (now called the &amp;#8216;excellence award&amp;#8217;). This year my &lt;a href='\'&gt;DSL book&lt;/a&gt; was up for an award and &lt;a href='http://drdobbs.com/joltawards/231500080?pgno=2'&gt;won a &amp;#8216;finalist award&amp;#8217;&lt;/a&gt; (essentially this means I was runner-up to the runner-ups).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I failed again, but this year I would have been very annoyed if I had won. I&amp;#8217;ve argued all year that Jez and Dave&amp;#8217;s book on &lt;a href='http://martinfowler.com/books/continuousDelivery.html'&gt;Continuous Delivery&lt;/a&gt; was the most important book released this year, and so I&amp;#8217;m glad that Dr Dobbs &lt;a href='http://drdobbs.com/joltawards/231500080?pgno=7'&gt;agreed with me&lt;/a&gt; and gave them the excellence award. Congratulations to Jez and Dave in joining the long list of people who have kept me away from this award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I keep missing the top prize, my signature series has a very good record with these awards. The 10 books in my series so far have picked up 1 finalist, 4 productivity and 2 excellence awards. Not a bad hit rate.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

I spent less than seven hours on it, but found it a worthwhile read. He takes a lightening tour through seven languages. It&amp;#8217;s not enough to go into much depth on any them, but it is enough to get a rough feel what&amp;#8217;s interesting about them. I&amp;#8217;d particularly recommend it if you are just starting to explore beyond the curly-brace languages that dominate so much of current programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I particularly appreciate about pragprog books is that you get access to electronic versions in multiple formats. This book worked very well on the Kindle, despite the small screen.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Malware alert on thoughtworks.com</title>
    <link href="http://martinfowler.com/snips/201102031214.html"/>
    <updated>2011-02-03T12:14:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>tag:martinfowler.com,2011-02-03:Malware-alert-on-thoughtworks-com</id>
    <category term=""/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We seem to have a shy but annoying piece of malware hanging out on thoughtworks.com. As far as we can tell, it manifests itself as a hidden iframe that redirects you to a site that hosts malware. We&amp;#8217;re a bit vague on this, as it only appears rarely so only a couple of people have seen it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our biggest sign of it is via google. Google reported our site on Jan 7th as having problems, we looked into it, didn&amp;#8217;t find anything, and Google&amp;#8217;s complaint went away very quickly. The flag went up again on Jan 31st and this time they emailed our webmaster. We looked again for a problem, without any success, so we asked them to re-review our site. Since then various Google diagnostics have raising and lowering the suspicious flag at a dizzying rate. As I write this the site is considered safe, but given the volatility of the opinion, we aren&amp;#8217;t sure about how things will go. (If you&amp;#8217;re concerned you can check &lt;a href='http://safebrowsing.clients.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=www.thoughtworks.com'&gt;Google&amp;#8217;s safebrowsing link&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly this is a bit of malware that&amp;#8217;s set to only show itself occasionally, which makes it harder to deal with. The tricky bit is to find how it&amp;#8217;s getting into the site. We&amp;#8217;ve checked all our content and not found anything suspicious, but it could be third party javascript libraries, could be our Drupal instance, could even be a problem with our apache installation - but we don&amp;#8217;t know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re investigating this further (including following the recommendations of &lt;a href='http://www.stopbadware.org/home/security'&gt;stopbadware&lt;/a&gt;) but haven&amp;#8217;t yet found the root cause, although we do have some strong suspects. If you see anything suspicious on our site or would like to pass on any suggestions, please contact &lt;a href='mailto:webmaster@thoughtworks.com'&gt;Andy Yates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, this problem &lt;a href='http://safebrowsing.clients.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=martinfowler.com'&gt;does not affect&lt;/a&gt; martinfowler.com - which is a static site built with my custom scripts, so is less likely to attract such a problem. But do let me know if you see anything.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the Churchill Club panel discussion on wikileaks on Wednesday. It&amp;#8217;s thoughtful and well worth watching &lt;a href='http://fora.tv/2011/01/19/WikiLeaks_Why_It_Matters_Why_It_Doesnt'&gt;the video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I particularly appreciated Daniel Ellsberg&amp;#8217;s picture of the climate of government secrecy and Roy&amp;#8217;s call to follow the example of librarians resisting secret gag orders. (There was a bit were it threatens to sink deep into the nature of libertarianism, but fortunately that didn&amp;#8217;t last long.) While my thoughts on wikileaks are complicated (and I&amp;#8217;ve not had the energy to write about them) I think the incident raises some very serious issues around the contending forces of privacy and openness.

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last year Cindy, my wife, did Boston&amp;#8217;s Avon walk to raise money for breast cancer research. She decided to it again this year. Last year a good proportion of the money she raised came from my readers, and we&amp;#8217;re hoping we can get another round of support from you this year. If you&amp;#8217;d like to donate, please go to her &lt;a href='http://avonwalk.org/goto/Cindy.Chabot'&gt;walk page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
